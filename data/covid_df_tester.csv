1737	Complex	973106	Gavin Evans	British Prime Minister Boris Johnson Hospitalized 10 Days After COVID-19 Diagnosis	"On Sunday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was hospitalized ""for tests"" because of ""persistent"" COVID-19 symptoms 10 days after he tested positive, CNN reports. 
Johnson reportedly went to the unspecified London hospital after his doctor advised him to do so. A press release from his office called the move ""precautionary."" 
On March 26, Johnson revealed he had tested positive and that he had been dealing with symptoms since that date. Britain had gone into lockdown two days earlier.
Since the 26th, Johnson has been quarantined at his Downing Street residence. He is the first known world leader to have contracted the virus. 
Roughly a month ago, right around the time the U.K. started dealing with an outbreak, Johnson garnered media coverage for saying he'd shook hands with coronavirus patients during a hospital visit.  
""I shook hands with everybody, you will be pleased to know, and I continue to shake hands,"" Johnson said during a press conference that took place on March 3. His positive test was registered 23 days later. 
On Saturday, Johnson's fiancée, Carrie Symonds, tweeted out that she'd spent a week in bed with coronavirus symptoms. She had not officially been tested for the disease, but said she felt ""stronger"" and ""on the mend"" following the week of rest:"
433	SBS	940858	Australia	NSW coronavirus death toll hits 18 as cases rise to 2637	"NSW has now recorded 18 COVID-19 deaths as the state's total number of cases rises to 2637.

NSW Health said on Monday the state had recorded 57 new cases - a drop on the previous day which was partly explained by fewer tests being done over the weekend.

The death toll rose to 18 after the deaths of an 86-year-old man and an 85-year-old man on Sunday.

It comes after NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller on Sunday announced an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the docking and disembarkation of passengers from the ill-fated Ruby Princess cruise ship.

The investigation - led by the NSW police homicide squad - aims to identify how passengers were allowed to disembark from the ship in Sydney, which is linked to 622 COVID-19 cases and at least 11 deaths across the country.

""The only way I can get to the bottom of whether our national biosecurity laws and our state laws were broken is through a criminal investigation,"" Mr Fuller said.

Mr Fuller told reporters transparency regarding patient health on board the cruise ship was a key question for the investigation.

The ship will dock in Port Kembla, near Wollongong on Monday.

It's expected to spend up to 10 days docked for medical assessments, treatment or emergency extractions of the crew, NSW Police say.

The investigation will cover the actions of the port authority, ambulance, police, the NSW Health department and Carnival Australia.

The NSW government on Sunday urged young people to take the COVID-19 pandemic seriously, revealing more than a quarter of the state's current coronavirus cases are in people aged under 29."
460	Hindustan Times	941178	Ht Correspondent	Industry in Chandigarh will need major impetus by government post lockdown, say businessmen	ChandigarhWith shops and manufacturing units closed due to the curfew imposed to stop the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), traders fear economic recovery will be difficult.It is for the first time that all business activity, trading and manufacturing, has been shut down in the city.“There is great uncertainty among businessmen as to what the future holds. People have even stopped planning how to manage the after-effects of the shutdown. We also don’t know for how long businesses will remain disturbed because of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Neeraj Bajaj of the Chandigarh Business Council.In the city’s industrial area, more than 30,000 are employed in manufacturing and service units.“Beyond the short-term struggle, the industry will need major impetus from the government in the short and long term. There should be moratorium period or extension of six months for payment of liabilities including utility bills, taxes and duties to the government,” said Pankaj Khanna, president, industries association, Chandigarh.Industry is also seeking for loans accounts, which become non-performing assets (NPA) during lockdown, to not be considered wilful defaulters.“Stimulus package for MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) should be considered for the financial year 2020-2021. Financial support for unorganized sectors will also be required,” Khanna said.Chandigarh Beopar Mandal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore on Friday, seeking help, as they struggle to deal with the acute economic crisis caused by the pandemic.“We request the government to allow us to pay our employees ₹4,000 to ₹5,000 per month as ration cost till the lockdown continues,” the traders’ body stated in its communiqué.“Most of our traders have taken overdraft/CC limits or term loans in order to run their businesses. When there isno business activity, paying these interests is also a big challenge,” said Charanjiv Singh, chairman of the Chandigarh Beopar Mandal.FACTORY WORKERS ISSUED CURFEW PASSES TO FACILITATE WAGE DISBURSEMENT TO LABOURTo resolve the issue of payment of wages to more than 25,000 factory workers in the city, the UT administration has started issuing curfew passes to factory officials to allow them to disburse wages.“So far, we have issued 120 curfew passes for factory officials. In case there are any problems regarding this, we are taking them up on priority basis,” said Harjit Singh Sandhu, director, industries.Due to restrictions on movement imposed because of the curfew, both factory owners and workers have been facing problems with the disbursement of wages. Various industry associations had taken up the issue with the administration.The UT labour department, too, has contacted industrialists and factory owners regarding payment of wages to the labourers. “Around 10,000 labourers have already received their salaries. Efforts are being made to ensure that the remaining labour is paid wages at the earliest,” said a senior UT official, wishing not to be named.Meanwhile, household workers like maids, gardeners, etc are finding it difficult to collect their monthly salaries because of curfew restrictions. “The administration should devise a plan that allows household workers to collect their salaries from houses of their employers. They are not able to visit their workplaces and they don’t have curfew passes either. This is causing them a great deal of hardship,” said RK Garg, a city based social activist.
460	Hindustan Times	1588290	Amanjeet Singh Salyal	Coronavirus in Chandigarh: Follow advisories, one cannot be too careful, says 23-year-old discharged patient	Chandigarh The 23-year-old man, discharged from the isolation ward of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, after two weeks of treatment, is elated to be home.“I am feeling perfectly fine,” he said, as he arrived at his house in Sector 19 around 6pm. Son of a senior UT official, the youth had tested positive for Covid-19 on March 22 after he came in contact with the brother of Chandigarh’s first coronavirus patient, a 23-year-old woman from Sector 21.“One cannot be too careful. Though I did not have severe symptoms, all of us, even the young, are not immune to it. Advisories for social distancing and hand washing should be followed religiously,” he said.“During the course of my stay at the hospital, I learnt that there is nothing to be afraid of, but we need to be careful. My morale was high and I was confident of quick recovery,” he said, while adding that those affected by the disease should not lose hope as recovery was possible.The youth reported to the hospital after his fever rose, alerting him that he could be infected. “In isolation, even though I was not allowed to move out, I spent my days reading and talking to my friends. The doctors, nurses and the supporting staff were immensely helpful,” he said.The 25-year-old brother of the city’s first positive patient was also discharged from GMCH on Saturday. He had tested positive on March 20 after coming in contact with his sister, who flew back from the United Kingdom on March 15 and tested positive on March 18. Their mother, who had also contracted the infection, was discharged on Saturday.On his recovery, the youth said following the instructions of the doctors was vital to get cured at the earliest. “Different bodies react to the virus differently. I did not have many symptoms, while other positive patients had cough and fever. So, precautions are a must to contain the spread of the virus,” he said.
460	Hindustan Times	941178	Ht Correspondent	Crackers sound jarring note as Chandigarh tricity lights up on PM Modi’s solemn plea	CHANDIGARH The stillness which had become so much a part of the tricity over the last two weeks was shattered by exploding firecrackers on Monday night as people in their enthusiasm to follow Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s solemn call for a candlelight vigil to unite to fight the coronavirus epidemic exceeded their brief to keep things low-key.Even as residents, following PM Modi’s Friday call to show solidarity and battle the pandemic, switched on their mobile phone lights and lit candles and diyas on Sunday at 9 pm, the sound of crackers sounded a jarring note. “This is the height of insanity and insensitivity to celebrate death and disease with so much pomp, show and bursting of crackers. This is a real wake of call for people who love India and the Indian ethos of compassion and humanism above all,” said, Pramod Sharma, who heads Yuvsatta, an NGO. “It was very peaceful initially. People had lit candles in their balconies, many were playing bhajans on their music systems, when suddenly crackers started popping. This was a solemn occasion, not something to celebrate,” said Nayna, a resident of Sector 43.Dr Ravindra Khaiwal , additional professor, environment health, The School of Public Health, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, said, “The purpose (of lighting diyas) was for showing solidarity with the citizens who are at the forefront of dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, but a few people resorted to bursting of crackers. That’s an undesired step,” he said. “We are in the midst of a pandemic and people are celebrating as if it’s Diwali,” quipped Mohali mayor Kulwant Singh. Former railways minister and Congressman Pawan Kumar Bansal felt this showed “the over enthusiasm and hype built up over the PM’s announcement. What was supposed to be voluntary action has now become a must-do thing.”Crackers were burst in most parts of the tricity. In some localities, enthusiastic Bharatiya Janata Party workers resorted to sloganeering in favour of their party and PM Modi. “It appears that people, by bursting crackers, did not understand the sensitivity involved in the issue. The call was not for this,” said Dr Pramod Kumar, director, Institute for Development and Communication (IDC), Chandigarh.
460	Hindustan Times	1588290	Amanjeet Singh Salyal	48% Covid-19 positive patients in Chandigarh tricity aged between 21-40	Chandigarh Health authorities have confirmed that majority of the 35 Covid-19 positive patients in the tricity, at 48.6%, are aged between 21 and 40.The age bracket hit the next hardest is between 41 and 60 years at 25.7%. Senior citizens, who are above 60 years, account for 20% of the positive cases, all from Mohali.In Chandigarh, it’s mostly the younger population that has been infected by the virus, as 72% of the 18 positive patients are in the age group of 21-40 years.Experts correlate this with the mobility of the young. “If we see the trend in Chandigarh, the five patients, who had travel history to foreign countries where Covid-19 cases were reported, are all below the age of 35,” said PVM Lakshmi, an epidemiologist at the Community Medicine and School of Public Health, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER). “The young individuals mostly mix up with their peers more than their families, and this is one reason that more cases were reported among the younger population in Chandigarh,” she added.On the contrary, the maximum cases in Mohali, at 46.6%, are in the 61 to 80 age group, while no one among the Chandigarh or Panchkula cases falls in this age bracket.Dr G Dewan, director health services, Chandigarh, said the disease’s trend here was the same as that found at the national level. Around 83% people infected in the country are below the age of 60, almost a similar trend seen in the tricity. “However, we need to be more cautious with regards to the senior citizens, especially those also suffering from comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension, as these have been associated with severe symptoms and complications,” he added.

  This is just one of a number of products to have seen significant price hikes during the lockdown, according to price comparison site PriceSpy.
  The indexed price across all 108,000 products listed on PriceSpy increased by 5 per cent in March 2020.

   The biggest growth was seen in chest freezers which surged by 28 per cent between March 1 and 31. What's more is that 90 per cent of the chest freezers listed were found to cost more by the end of the month.
  Webcams, heating and cooling products, washing machines, desktop PCs and ebook readers all shot up in price over this period.
   ""Shockingly, the findings revealed 90 per cent of the top 10 most-click-on chest freezers cost more to buy on 31st March compared to 1st March, before the national Covid-19 alert system was implemented,"" said Liisa Matinvesi-Bassett, New Zealand country manager for PriceSpy.
  ""Similarly, over three quarters [80 per cent] of the top 10 most-clicked-on webcams were more expensive to purchase at the end of the month compared to the start. A similar trend was also apparent for whiteware goods, with 70 per cent of the top 10 most-clicked-on items costing more on 31st March compared to 1st March.""
         The price hikes have been applied across categories. Photo / File   
  Matinvesi-Bassett said that while fluctuations in pricing are to be expected, the price hikes in this instance have been ""extraordinary"".
  ""If we are to compare like-for-like and look at the biggest savings offered across the top 10 most -clicked-on products across the same shopping categories, the most substantial saving found was for the Apple Mac Mini (2018), which cost $190 less on 31st compared to 1st March,"" she said.
         There have been massive differences in prices. Photo / File   
  ""During such unprecedented times, our key piece of advice to consumers who need to make an essential purchase right now is to be vigilant and conduct important price research before they commit and buy, as our insights suggest many products have received a price hike over this last month.""
  This data comes off the back of the Government's decision to allow certain retailers to sell a number of essential goods to get New Zealanders through the lockdown.
   The move allowed the likes of the Warehouse, Noel Leeming, Briscoes and Mitre 10 to sell essential goods, such as heaters, whiteware and computers.

  The decision was made in recognition of the need for people to safely isolate, stay connected to one another and work or study from home.
  The stores have, however, faced massive demand as Kiwis rushed online to get their hands on essentials.
  Key products include heaters, dehumidifiers, light bulbs and globes, hand tools, padlocks, firewood, batteries, sealants and silicones, work boots and gumboots, workwear, torches, spouting, downpipes, smoke alarms, child safety items and small household appliances.

MANILA, Philippines s— For Pope Francis at the Vatican, and for Christians worldwide from churches large and small, this will be an Easter like none other: The joyous message of Christ’s resurrection will be delivered to empty pews.

Worries about the coronavirus outbreak have triggered widespread cancellations of Holy Week processions and in-person services. Many pastors will preach on TV or online, tailoring sermons to account for the pandemic.



Many extended families will reunite via Face Time and Zoom rather than around a communal table laden with an Easter feast on April 12.
  

“I’ll miss Mass and the procession,” said Aida Franco, 86, a retired teacher from Quito, Ecuador. “But God knows better.”

Near-empty basilica

Pope Francis, the first Pontiff from Latin America, will be celebrating Mass for Palm Sunday, Holy Thursday and Easter in a near-empty St. Peter’s Basilica, instead of in the huge square outside filled with Catholic faithful.

In the Pope’s native Argentina, the archbishopric of La Plata encouraged the faithful to use any type of plant at home for a “virtual” blessing that will be live-streamed during Palm Sunday services this weekend.

The pandemic has prompted the cancellation of a renowned annual tradition of sawdust and handmade flower carpets coating the streets of Antigua, a colonial Guatemalan city, during its Holy Week procession. Instead, some residents will make smaller carpets to display outside their homes.

“We know this is happening because of some message from God,” said Cesar Alvarez, who has been making the multicolored carpets with his family for 28 years. “But we’re taking it with a lot of sadness.”
				

					
			

In some communities, there are innovative efforts to boost Easter time morale.

Distancing at egg hunt

At Asbury United Methodist Church in Prairie Village, Kansas, family ministries director Heather Jackson is organizing an Easter egg hunt that embraces social distancing.

Parents and children are creating colorful images of Easter eggs to display in windows or on garage doors, and the “hunt” will entail families driving around in their cars, or strolling on foot, trying to spot as many eggs as possible.

“It’s about keeping people safe while maintaining that sense of joy,” Jackson said. “It will be a difficult time because it’s a time for families to come together and right now we just can’t do that.”

If not for the virus, 32-year-old Chris Burton—a writer, teacher and devout Baptist in Brooklyn, New York—would be planning a trip to Maryland for Easter dinner with his family. Instead, he plans to watch the online service of his church, Trinity Baptist, and then catch up with relatives by phone.

Burton, who has experienced five bouts of pneumonia since 2011, has blogged about the need to shelter in place. Yet he still hopes this Easter will rekindle the uplifting emotions he’s cherished since wearing his Easter suit in childhood.

“All that’s happening doesn’t mean we need to be somber,” he said.

Priest-carrying vehicles

In Venezuela, Catholic officials said that after the Holy Week liturgies, some priests would try to take the Blessed Sacrament—the wine and bread of Holy Communion—on a vehicle and, using loudspeakers, invite congregants to join in spirit from their windows and balconies.
				

					
			

A similar use of priest-carrying vehicles was adapted in the Philippines, Asia’s bastion of Catholicism. Locals lined up in front of their homes in several districts of Manila and Quezon City, which are entering its fourth week of a lockdown that has brought the frenetic metropolis nearly to a halt.

The priests made signs of the cross as they rolled past waving residents marking Palm Sunday, the start of the week that culminates with the observance of Easter.

“This celebration will continue despite the spread of the virus,” said Bong Sosa, who attended wearing a mask crafted from a water cooler bottle.

In Brazil, the world’s biggest Catholic country, Rio de Janeiro’s huge Christ the Redeemer statue has been closed indefinitely. Large Holy Week gatherings are banned in several states after a federal court overruled a decree by President Jair Bolsonaro exempting religious services from quarantine measures.

Many faithful across Latin America say they’ll miss Holy Week’s observances, yet there is acceptance of the cancellations.

Health first

“It’s sad because we can’t be with our Lord in his Calvary, but it’s fine,” said Felipe Navarrete of Santiago, Chile. “The health of the population comes first, and we have to be responsible with older people who join these rituals the most.”

Many pastors are pondering their upcoming Easter sermons, including the Rev. Steven Paulikas of All Saints Episcopal Church in Brooklyn. His sermon will be transmitted online but delivered in an empty church.

“It’s started me thinking about the empty tomb,” he said, referring to the biblical account of Christ’s resurrection after his crucifixion.
				

					
			

“That emptiness was actually the first symbol of this new life,” Paulikas said.

On the evening of April 9—Holy Thursday commemorating the Last Supper of Jesus and his apostles—Paulikas is organizing a communal supper for his congregation, hoping members will join via Face Time.

Sounds and images

At St. Ambrose Catholic Church in Brunswick, Ohio, Father Bob Stec is organizing a pre-Easter initiative, arranging for each of the parish’s 5,500 families to get a friendly call from another member.

He’s expecting upwards of 20,000 people to watch the online Easter service.

“We’re going to try to flood their senses visually and audibly with the sounds and images that will give them hope,” he said.

      CITY OF SAN FERNANDO, Pampanga, Philippines — The new coronavirus is poised to bring to a stop this Holy Week the crucifixion rites in the village of San Pedro Cutud here.

Barangay Cutud, where some 5,000 penitents would end their flagellation and crucifixion on Good Friday, has been placed on total lockdown since Palm Sunday to stop the spread of infection.

Six policemen were sent to the area to guard the three entrances to the village, said Cutud chair Remegio de la Cruz. “I do not want foreigners and local spectators to come,” he told the Inquirer by phone.



The village’s Good Friday events, ending on a version of Calvary, had been drawing 30,000 to 50,000 spectators annually due to real-life crucifixion rites.
  

Hardheaded villagers

“This coronavirus disease must be stopped from being transmitted,” De la Cruz said. “There are some villagers who are hardheaded, but I am strict. So they better obey me or else.”

Ruben Enaje, 59, a house and billboard painter, regularly took on the role of Jesus Christ in “Via Crucis” (Way of the Cross), the play staged on the streets of Cutud.

But local officials have asked Enaje and other penitents to drop the crucifixion rites after President Duterte ordered a stop to the gathering of people in big numbers to curb the spread of COVID-19.

Enaje said he would just carry a 37-kilogram wooden cross from his house to the hill on Good Friday.

      MANILA, Philippines — No less than the country’s top medical and legal groups have called on authorities to disclose the identities of COVID-19 patients and so-called persons under investigation (PUIs), saying many patients continue to withhold their true medical history thus endangering the thinning ranks of healthcare workers.

The Philippine Medical Association and Philippine College of Surgeons together with the Integrated Bar of the Philippines appealed to COVID-19 patients and PUIs to voluntarily waive the confidentiality of their medical information and inform those they have recently been in close contact with.

They also urged the Department of Health to “prudently use and promptly share the medical information” to all concerned so they could take precautionary and remedial measures. Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said he “strongly” supported the call and affirmed the “ethical and legal basis” laid down by the Philippine Medical Association and the Data Privacy Commission to justify waiving the medical confidential rule “in times of public health emergency.”



He also strongly supports the call of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines on COVID-19 positive individuals and PUIs “for the waiver of confidentiality of their medical condition,” Guevarra told reporters on Sunday.
  

“This will enable other people they have been in close contact with to take the necessary precautions or remedial measures to protect themselves, without having to further burden the Department of Health with the tedious task of contact tracing,” he added.

The three medical and legal groups made the appeal in a joint statement on April 4, three weeks since the enhanced community quarantine to contain the outbreak.

In justifying their call to waive the medical confidentiality rule, they reported increasing incidents in which COVID-19 patients continue to withhold their true medical condition when seeking treatment or hospital admission “thereby compromising the health institutions and the health workers,” many of whom have died or fell ill from the infectious disease.

Even without the individual waiver, they said, existing laws and rules grant the government “sufficient authority and basis” to lift the confidentiality of the medical condition of COVID-19 patients and PUIs.

These include Republic Act 11332 or the 2018 Law on Reporting of Communicable Diseases, which makes illegal the “non-cooperation of persons and entities” in times of public health emergencies.
				

					
			

The confidentiality of a patient’s medical data and details is “not absolute” and can be lifted “when the public health and safety so demand” or “when the patient waives his right,” the three groups pointed out.

Article III Section 3 of the Code of Ethics of the Medical Profession, they said, exempts a physician from keeping private and highly confidential a person’s medical information “when required by law, ordinance or administrative order in the promotion of justice, safety and public health.”

The Health Privacy Code specifying the Joint Administrative Order No. 2016-0002 or the privacy guidelines for the implementation of the Philippine Health Information Exchange, also allows that “in case of emergency where time is of the essence, disclosure may be made even without court order.”

      MANILA, Philippines — The new coronavirus failed to keep Filipino Catholics from observing Palm Sunday.

Priests went around communities in lockdown to bless palm fronds waved by people from the front of their houses or delivered blessing from the back of trucks and motorized tricycles.

In a photo posted on CBCP­News, the official news service of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP), a priest blesses palm fronds from a tricycle in Borongan City, Eastern Samar.



Manila Auxiliary Bishop Broderick Pabillo, in his homily during Palm Sunday Mass at Manila Cathedral that was live-streamed on Facebook, said liturgical activities this year would be a lot different, “but Holy Week must continue.”
  

Bright side

Catholics in many parts of the world may miss the “externalities” of the celebrations, he said, but “this may be a good chance for us to go into the essence of what we are doing.”

“There is always a bright side in what is happening even in this COVID-19 pandemic,” he said.

Pabillo urged the faithful to spend the remaining days of the Luzon lockdown in prayer and reflection.

“Let us not mind so much that we are already in the fourth week of the lockdown. Let us not complain. But let us use this silence and inactivity of the lockdown this Holy Week to reflect and to pray,” he said.

He encouraged the faithful to think of the difficulties brought about by COVID-19 as a way of being one with Jesus, who died for mankind.
				

					
			

“Of course, after four weeks, there are already lots of complaints, not only of inconvenience, not only of boredom, but, even for some, because of great need. They might be hungry already. Let us join all these sufferings to that of Jesus. He loves us so much that he suffered for us,” Pabillo said.

“We welcome him today, let us continue to welcome him. We recognize him and he still comes to us in the ordinariness of our lives even when we are under quarantine. It’s good to pause and see how is the Lord coming to us during these days,” he added.

This Holy Week is a good time to reflect on why Jesus suffered so much and that his suffering should “lead us to sorrow and gratitude—sorrow for our sins, for our indifference, and gratitude for his great love and solidarity with us,” Pabillo said.

Not less holy

“We may be celebrating this year’s Holy Week differently, but hopefully, more deeply,” he said, adding that the absence of traditional religious activities does not make Holy Week less holy.

Lingayen-Dagupan Archbishop Socrates Villegas echoed Pabillo’s views, saying Holy Week is about love, not rituals.

“Love makes us holy. Love, not rituals, is the spirit of Holy Week,” he said.

Fr. Jerome Secillano, executive secretary of the CBCP public affairs committee, also said Holy Week “shouldn’t be less holy since what makes it really holy is the sacrifice of Christ and not the participation of people.”

TACLOBAN CITY, Leyte, Philippines — Zenaida Oledan woke up at 5:30 a.m. on Sunday determined to do one thing.

“I want to have my palm fronds blessed,” said the 54-year-old mother of four.



Oledan was among several residents who lined the city streets of Barangay 6 to observe Palm Sunday, the start of Holy Week—the most somber time of the year in Christianity.
  

Going to the community

But unlike in previous years, the Catholic faithful were requested to stay at home in a bid to contain the spread of the new coronavirus, which causes the deadly COVID-19.

Msgr. Erlito Maraya, head priest of Sacred Heart Parish in Tacloban, went out to the community to bless the people’s homemade palm fronds.

Oledan was glad about Maraya’s bringing the Palm Sunday tradition to people’s homes. “At least even during this time of COVID-19, we’re still able to observe Palm Sunday,” she said, holding the palm she had bought.

In Cebu, Archbishop Jose Palma presided over Palm Sunday Mass at an empty Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral. But Gov. Gwendolyn Garcia was there to see him consecrate Cebu to the Our Lady of Guadalupe, the island’s patroness.

“In the midst of fear and anxiety caused by COVID-19, even great nations are at a loss about what to do. We have no solution. [The best we can do] is to bend down our knees in prayer,” Palma said in his homily.
				

					
			

Gratitude to medical workers

He expressed gratitude to all medical workers who, he said, were like Jesus who sacrificed his life for the good of many.

“These people exposed themselves to risk and yet they are there. We admire people who are willing to take the risk knowing that life is precious. This is the image of Jesus who offered his life so that others may live,” Palma said.

“In time of COVID, we should be serious in giving value to life. We’re confronted with a serious case and I hope people will follow what authorities are implementing,” he added.

On March 17, Palma ordered the suspension of Masses in Cebu amid increasing COVID-19 cases. He urged parishes in the archdiocese to use technology to bring church services to people, especially those who are in quarantine.

On Negros Island, people attended services — Catholic and Protestant — through television.

Some of them put palm fronds on their gates as a reminder of Palm Sunday.

254	Philippine Daily Inquirer	956626	Besguerra	Fighting a pandemic: When healers need healing themselves	"THE BEST AND WORST IMPULSES Risking infection by the coronavirus as they provide care for patients on their watch, medical workers also face discrimination by people afraid for their lives. —PHOTO COURTESY OF KATH VALDEZ


MANILA, Philippines — “You really need to be strong in this profession,’’ said Kath Valdez, a ward nurse at the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) in Manila, who has seen how the usually crowded halls of PGH turned empty and eerily quiet, except for the muffled suffering of patients battling a virulent disease that has also taken its toll on health workers like her.

“(You have) to put so much heart into it so that you can help people (deal), not only with their physical pain but also the emotional and mental challenges they are going through,” she said.



After PGH was designated by the Department of Health as an “end referral hospital” for COVID-19 cases, Valdez recalled, she started taking care of one patient whose condition was made worse by bouts of depression. Two of the patient’s family members had died from COVID-19, while the rest were recovering.
  

“She is isolated and alone in PGH, and cannot do anything. It’s too sad to see patients like that. All I can offer is myself, a person who will listen to her,” said Valdez.

Health workers get so invested in their work that they sometimes forget to take care of themselves, she said, and “this eventually leads to burnout and similar challenges.”

Another source of anguish

But lately, another source of their mental anguish has surfaced — one that stalks nurses and health workers the moment they step out of the hospital.

Valdez has experienced it herself: One day as she walked home, her neighbors hurried back inside their houses, avoiding her like the plague. She has also heard stories of health workers being forced out of their rented places because of fear that they could infect the entire community.

“I know (people) are just being careful,” she said. “But I wish they would be kinder and more considerate to us, especially during this time of crisis,” Valdez said.
				

					
			

Support groups

To help themselves cope, nurses in the state-run hospital turn to their support group—“PGH Care Society”—to help each other out of emotional and psychological lows through professional and peer interventions.

Other groups, such as Ugat Foundation and the University of the Philippines Diliman’s PsycServ (UPD PsycServ), have been offering telepsychotherapy and psycho-emotional counseling services for front-line health workers and people experiencing stress or anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Like other PGH nurses, Valdez has developed the fear of getting the virus and infecting others, as well as a sense of helplessness for not being able to do everything for the patients.

“We’ve also faced (cases of) infectious diseases in the past, but this is something that we didn’t expect to blow up like this. It totally changed our working environment. There is fear, anxiety, and uncertainty all around,” said Valdez, who lives with friends in Manila while her entire family is abroad.

The PGH Care Society, a mental health advocacy group whose members include Valdez, provides a platform for nurses to freely express their feelings as a form of unburdening and release. Through online exchanges, they can hopefully unload negative feelings and deal more strongly with “one of the most challenging times of their career,” Valdez said.

Online counseling

Ugat Foundation, meanwhile, is a group helping Filipino families, overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and marginalized individuals cushion the physical and psychological impact of the coronavirus outbreak.

On April 2, it launched Ugat Sandaline, an online platform that provides psycho-emotional counseling services to people affected by the pandemic, especially medical front-liners and other responders deployed by the government.

“They need a lot of support now, and hopefully, crisis counseling empowers them in their valiant efforts to fight COVID-19 and ensure the safety and health of the Filipino people,” the group said.
				

					
			

Ugat Sandaline volunteers include psychologists, mental health professionals, and psychology graduate students who are trained to listen to and empathize with those needing emotional support, whether through video, voice call or online chat.

“In cases such as pandemics, when compliance is critical to the nation’s efforts to ‘flatten the curve,’ feeling heard or having an outlet to ventilate feelings will hopefully also enable more (people) to comply with national and local government efforts,” the group said in a statement.

For other ‘essential’ workers

A third help group, UPD PsycServ, has expanded its free telepsychotherapy services to reach out not only to health workers but also to persons under investigation or monitoring for coronavirus symptoms, and COVID-19-positive individuals and their relatives.

It also offers a comforting hand to security guards, store cashiers, janitors and other “essential” workers who still have to go to work—and face the risk of being infected—while the Luzon-wide lockdown is in effect.

Online sessions with the group can be scheduled through text, Viber or an online form posted on the group’s Facebook page.

Sometimes a simple “kumusta” (how are you?) suffices to renew their strength, Valdez said.

“As health workers, we’re used to asking others: Kumusta ka? So it’s time that we also take care of our fellow nurses and front-liners,” she said. “That one simple question can totally change someone’s perspective and feelings.”

9	Ars Technica	963482	Timothy B. Lee	Zoombombing is a crime, not a prank, prosecutors warn	"Coronavirus-related social distancing measures have given a big popularity boost to Zoom, a video conferencing platform that's known for its ease of use but not necessarily strong security or privacy protections. Internet trolls and other troublemakers have responded with ""Zoombombing"": joining Zoom meetings uninvited and disrupting them. Zoombombers have exposed themselves to schoolchildren and shouted racial slurs.

In a Friday statement, federal prosecutors in Michigan warned the public that Zoombombing isn't a harmless prank; it's a crime.

""Hackers are disrupting conferences and online classrooms with pornographic and/or hate images and threatening language,"" wrote the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan. ""Anyone who hacks into a teleconference can be charged with state or federal crimes.""

Possible charges include ""disrupting a public meeting, computer intrusion, using a computer to commit a crime, hate crimes, fraud, or transmitting threatening communications,"" the prosecutors warn. All of these charges come with the potential for fines and jail time, the authorities say.

The exact charges a Zoombomber faces would presumably depend on how they gained access to a Zoom meeting and what they did to disrupt it. For example, some Zoom meetings are advertised publicly, which might make it hard to make a computer intrusion charge stick. But someone could still be prosecuted for things they said or did to disrupt the meeting after joining it.

“You think Zoombombing is funny? Let’s see how funny it is after you get arrested,” Michigan US attorney Matthew Schneider said in Friday's release. “If you interfere with a teleconference or public meeting in Michigan, you could have federal, state, or local law enforcement knocking at your door.”

In a recent story, Ars Technica security reporter Dan Goodin explained how Zoom users can protect themselves from Zoombombing attacks. He noted that meetings can be password-protected, and he advised against announcing login information on social media or other public channels.

Goodin notes that hosts can disable Zoom's ""Join Before Host"" setting to ensure that the host is in control of a meeting from the outset. Zoom also has a ""waiting room"" feature, allowing a host to verify participants before allowing them to join the meeting."
1105	ITV	2423935	Photo: Pippa	Boris Johnson spends night in hospital as he battles coronavirus	"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is spending the night in hospital after he was admitted for tests as his coronavirus symptoms persist.
He will stay for “as long as needed” in the London NHS hospital where he was taken as a “precautionary step” on the advice of his doctor – rather than as an emergency.
The news came just an hour after the Queen delivered a message of hope to the nation amid the Covid-19 pandemic, saying “we will overcome it” although we “may have more still to endure”.





  A total of 4,934 patients – including frontline healthcare workers – have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK according to the latest figures issued by the Department of Health.
Mr Johnson, 55, tested positive for the virus 10 days ago, and has been in self-isolation inside his Downing Street flat since.
A Number 10 spokeswoman said: “On the advice of his doctor, the Prime Minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests.
“This is a precautionary step, as the Prime Minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after testing positive for the virus.
“The Prime Minister thanks NHS staff for all of their incredible hard work and urges the public to continue to follow the Government’s advice to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.”





  US President Donald Trump was among the well-wishers, starting Sunday night’s White House press briefing by saying Mr Johnson was “a great friend of mine” and adding: “I’m sure he is going to be fine, he’s a strong man, a strong person.”
In a rare televised address to the nation, the Queen personally thanked frontline NHS staff, care workers and others for “selflessly” carrying out their essential roles which had brought “us closer to a return to more normal times”.
She thanked others for staying at homes, separated from friends and family, and echoed the words of Forces’ sweetheart Dame Vera Lynne’s Second World War anthem, when she said “we will meet again”.
It came as:
– Scotland’s chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, resigned following criticism for visiting her second home and not adhering to social distancing advice.
– The Department of Health said the number of reported coronavirus-related hospital deaths had risen by 621 to 4,934 as of 5pm on Saturday, up from 4,313 the day before.
– Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow confirmed Lynsay Coventry, 54, who died on Thursday, was the first serving midwife to die after testing positive for the virus.
– Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned outdoor exercise could be banned if people continued to flout the social distancing rules.





  Mr Johnson remains “in charge of the Government” and in contact with ministerial colleagues and officials despite his hospital admission, a spokesman said.
But de facto deputy prime minister Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, is expected to chair the daily Covid-19 meeting on Monday morning in Mr Johnson’s place.
His persistent symptoms are understood to include a high temperature, and it was considered sensible for doctors to see the PM in person.
Mr Johnson’s pregnant fiancee Carrie Symonds said on Saturday that she was “on the mend” after spending a week in bed after also suffering coronavirus symptoms.





  The 32-year-old, who is expecting the couple’s baby in early summer, has been self-isolating in Camberwell, south London, with the couple’s dog Dilyn.
The Prime Minister revealed on March 27 that he had tested positive for Covid-19 and was self-isolating with “mild symptoms” including a high temperature and persistent cough
He has shared several video updates from his Number 11 flat since the diagnosis, and stepped outside to join the nationwide clap for key workers on Thursday evening.
Mr Johnson has not been seen publicly since, but spoke to new Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer on Saturday afternoon.
Sir Keir wished the PM a “speedy recovery” after the announcement."
1451	Slate	972353	Daniel Politi	Bronx Zoo Tiger Is First of Its Kind to Test Positive For Coronavirus	"Nadia, a four-year-old female Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo, is seen in an undated photo provided by the zoo in New York.

Wildlife Conservation Society




  

  
  Nadia, a four-year-old female Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo, has become the first tiger in the world to test positive for the coronavirus. It is the first known case of an animal contracting the coronavirus in the United States.  Nadia’s sister Azul, two Amur tigers, and three African lions have also developed a dry cough, a symptom that is typical of COVID-19 patients. Because of the difficulty of obtaining samples from big cats, only one was tested. Besides a bit of loss of appetite all the Bronx Zoo animals are doing well, the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo said in a statement. The zoo has been closed since March 16.



  



  



  
  The U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed the finding and said it marked the first case of a tiger testing positive for COVID-19. The big cats were likely infected by an asymptomatic staff member.



  



  



  
  Even though all the big cats infected with COVID-19 are expected to make a full recovery the positive test raises fresh questions about how the virus is transmitted to animals. No pets in the United States have tested positive for the virus and there is no evidence to suggest that animals can transmit COVID-19 to people. A dog in Hong Kong tested positive, which led officials to conclude animals could test positive if they had been exposed by humans but could not transmit the virus to humans.



  
  The USDA says anyone who is sick with the coronavirus should restrict contact with animals as much as possible. If someone who is sick with the coronavirus must take care of a pet or be around animals, “they should wash their hands before and after the interaction,” notes the USDA. Experts also recommend that pets of owners who are infected with COVID-19 should be kept inside as much as possible."

1476	Straits Times	941192		Ecuador city runs out of coffins amid coronavirus crisis	"QUITO (AFP) - Soaring numbers of coronavirus deaths in Ecuador's second city Guayaquil have led to a shortage of coffins, forcing locals to resort to using cardboard boxes, city authorities said on Sunday (April 5).

Authorities in the Pacific port city said they had received a donation of 1,000 pressed cardboard caskets from local producers, and delivered them for use in two local cemeteries.

""It's so they can meet demand,"" a city hall spokesman told AFP. ""There are either no coffins in the city or they are extremely expensive.""

Businessman Santiago Olivares, who owns a chain of funeral homes, said his company was unable to keep up with demand.

""I sold the 40 that I had at the downtown branch, and 40 others from my headquarters. I had to order 10 more at the weekend and they've run out,"" Olivares told AFP.

The cheapest coffins currently cost around $400.

Olivares said a 15-hour curfew in the city was contributing to the shortage of basic raw materials for coffin makers like wood and metal.

Last week, residents posted videos on social media showing abandoned bodies in the streets in the Latin American city worst hit by the pandemic.

The government called in troops to pick up 150 corpses from streets and homes earlier this week after mortuary workers in the city were unable to keep up with a backlog of removals.

The cardboard coffins ""will be a great help in providing a dignified burial for people who died during this health emergency,"" the Guayaquil mayor's office wrote on Twitter.

Ecuador reported 3,646 cases of the coronavirus on Sunday, including 180 deaths, the majority of them occurring in Guayaquil and its surrounding province of Guayas."
15	CBS News	4496		Why John Dickerson wrote about acknowledging each other's grief as the coronavirus takes its toll	"Amid the confusion and anxiety of coronavirus news, John Dickerson wants people to take time to acknowledge what has been lost. For an increasing number of Americans, that means a loved one.

Behind the growing numbers of people who have died from COVID-19, there are friends and family members in mourning. Recently, Dickerson saw that sorrow up close when he spoke to a friend whose close family member died from the virus. He also saw the disconnect between what that family felt and the broader political debate occurring about the coronavirus.

To make sense of that clash, he wrote about it in an article for The Atlantic.

""The response has been pretty powerful, from all sorts of different people,"" Dickerson told 60 Minutes Overtime. ""And so a lot of people when they read it, passed it around, either because they were experiencing grief, or because they knew somebody that was, or because they were having a kind of anticipatory grief and sorrow about this confusing moment that we're all in.""

Part of what makes this moment so confusing, Dickerson said, is that people can no longer do what they usually do when a loved one dies. Due to social distancing and mandates against gatherings, they cannot have a funeral, nor hug relatives who have gathered. In most instances, they are not even able to be with their loved one in person before they die, especially if its due to COVID-19.

""All of the normal coping mechanisms are taken away,"" Dickerson said. ""And that is an acute situation for the people going through it, but also for the rest of us. This is something new for all of us to be experiencing this at the same time.""

For Dickerson, that sense of unity in grief is what will help people get through it. He pointed to the collective applause that New Yorkers give at 7 pm each evening in thanks to health care workers who are taking care of the sick. The sounds of clapping hands and banging pots, he said, goes beyond the intended message.

""It's also all of us neighbors hearing each other, participating in that together, all having the same human reaction, regardless of our politics or our creed or our religions or races or where we come from, that we're all expressing the same kind of gratitude at the same time,"" he said, ""which is not only a good thing to be doing collectively, but it also reminds us all that we, at the very basic level, are all human beings.""

466	News	955084	Ap	Tiger tests positive for coronavirus at NYC’s Bronx Zoo	"A tiger at the Bronx Zoo has tested positive for the new coronavirus in what is believed to be the first known infection in an animal in the US or a tiger anywhere, federal officials and the zoo said Sunday. 
The four-year-old Malayan tiger named Nadia – and six other tigers and lions that have also fallen ill – are believed to have been infected by a zoo employee who wasn’t yet showing symptoms, the zoo said. The first animal started showing symptoms on March 27, and all are doing well and expected to recover, a zoo spokesman said. The zoo has been closed to the public since March 16 amid the surging coronavirus outbreak in New York.
“These are extremely hard days for all of us – no matter where we live and work. We will ensure that whatever we can learn from these circumstances will be used to better understand and combat this disease,” zoo director Jim Breheny said in a statement.
The finding raises new questions about transmission of the virus in animals. The US Department of Agriculture, which confirmed Nadia’s test result at its veterinary lab, says there are no known cases of the virus in US pets or livestock.
“There doesn’t appear to be, at this time, any evidence that suggests that the animals can spread the virus to people or that they can be a source of the infection in the United States,” Dr Jane Rooney, a veterinarian and a USDA official, said in an interview.
A USDA spokesperson said on Sunday it was not recommending routine coronavirus testing of animals in zoos or elsewhere or of zoo employees. Still, DR Rooney said a small number of animals in the US had been tested through the USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories, and all those tests came back negative except Nadia’s.
The coronavirus outbreaks around the world are driven by person-to-person transmission, experts say.
There have been a handful of reports outside the US of pet dogs or cats becoming infected after close contact with contagious people, including a Hong Kong dog that tested positive for a low level of the pathogen in February and early March. Hong Kong agriculture authorities concluded that pet dogs and cats couldn’t pass the virus to human beings but could test positive if exposed by their owners.
Some researchers have been trying to understand the susceptibility of different animal species to the virus and to determine how it spreads among animals, according to the Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health. The American Veterinary Medical Association and the federal Centres for Disease Control and Prevention have been recommending that out of an abundance of caution, people ill with the coronavirus should limit contact with animals – advice that the veterinary group reiterated after learning of the tiger’s test result.
In general, the CDC also advises people to wash their hands after handling animals and do other things to keep pets and their homes clean. At the Bronx Zoo, Nadia, her sister Azul, two Amur tigers and three African lions developed dry coughs, and some of the cats exhibited some wheezing and loss of appetite, said Dr Paul Calle, the zoo’s chief veterinarian.
Only Nadia was tested because it takes anaesthesia to get a sample from a big cat. Her temperature was taken at the same time, and it was normal, Dr Calle said. The seven sickened cats live in two areas at the zoo, and the animals had contact with the same worker, who is doing OK, zoo officials said. They said they are taking “appropriate preventive measures” for the staffers who care for the ailing animals, and there are no signs of illness in other big cats on the property.
For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as a fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and can be fatal."
466	News	943220	Hannah Paine	Coles launches its own $80 groceries box to rival Woolworths	"Coles has launched a Community Box that it will deliver to its vulnerable customers who have been most impacted by coronavirus and panic buying. 
The supermarket giant will deliver a range of non-perishable basics for $80, the same price Woolworths charges for its Basics Box.
“As part of our commitment to helping those most in need during this challenging time, we’ve created the Coles Community Box,” a Coles spokesperson said.
“Delivered direct to homes in two packages by Australia Post, the Coles Community Box contains grocery items and household items for healthy meals and snacks, plus some everyday essentials.”
RELATED: Follow the latest coronavirus updates
Coles' box contains a range of pantry samples including long-life milk, tea or instant coffee, cereal, baked beans, pasta and wraps.
The Community Box will be only available to Coles' priority service customers as “our priority right now is helping our most vulnerable customers and giving them access to grocery items and everyday essentials”.
Those who are eligible for Coles' priority service are those over the age of 65, indigenous Australians over the age of 50 as well as aged and disability care businesses.
Coles has been forced to limit its home delivery to just those who are “in genuine need” as well as pausing its click and collect services, meaning customers can no longer pick up their pre-purchased supermarkets in store.
WOOLIES BOX DIVIDES SHOPPERS
Last week Woolworths launched its own version, an $80 Basics Box that is available for any customer who is unable to visit the supermarket.
The $80 box includes contactless doorstep delivery by Australia Post within an estimated time of two to five business days of order.
Customers can’t switch, change or choose items within the box, with Woolies explaining that streamlining the picking process is part of ensuring customers get the essential items as quickly as possible.
However, the box has divided shoppers, with some slamming its contents in a post in Facebook group Budgeting, Food, Savings Ideas, Life Help Australia on Friday.
""Wow. Not even bread?"" one person wrote, while another claimed it was “overpriced for what you get”.
RELATED: Science behind Aussie toilet paper frenzy
“Does seem a bit of a rip-off for the price tag, is there some items missing?” one person commented.
However, others argued the box was “better than nothing” and the point of it was to provide “non-perishable staples” to the vulnerable.
In response, Woolworths told news.com.au it had developed the Basics Box to “meet an essential community need” and the supermarket “will be making no profit from it”.
“While it’s a far cry from a fully customised home delivery, it’s a good value offer covering the basics,” the spokesman said.
“The price includes delivery to the door and helps cover costs associated with the picking, packing and transport of goods.
“By streamlining the mix of products and partnering with Australia Post and DHL, we’re able to get more food to more vulnerable customers much faster.
“We continue to work hard behind the scenes to ramp up our home delivery capacity for the benefit of priority assist customers.”"
264	Daily Caller	963638	Mary Margaret Olohan	‘I Felt A Real Pain In My Heart For My Country’: David Benham Arrested Outside NC Abortion Clinic Over Coronavirus Orders	"Police arrested David Benham on Saturday, saying he defied North Carolina’s coronavirus stay-at-home orders.
 Benham and his sons were supporting pro-life sidewalk counselors who offer counseling to “at-risk mothers and babies” heading in and out of Preferred Women’s Health Center. 
 “You know I am well within my constitutional authority to be here,” Benham said as he was handcuffed, a video showed. “You know that we are doing the right thing.”
 
Police arrested David Benham and his son Saturday for violating coronavirus distancing orders while offering sidewalk counseling outside a North Carolina abortion clinic — an incident he said was targeted.
 Benham, who started the pro-life sidewalk counseling service Cities4Life in 2010, told the Daily Caller News Foundation he received a call from some of the sidewalk counselors Saturday morning saying there were police outside Preferred Women’s Health Center in Charlotte, North Carolina.
 
 Benham is a Christian entrepreneur and former professional baseball player who gained media attention after he and his brother Jason Benham’s reality HGTV show was canceled over the brothers’ religious views.
 Three members of Cities4Life were at the clinic offering counseling Saturday, according to Benham, who said he drove to the clinic with two of his sons after hearing about the police.
 “We are a federally recognized 501(c)(3) public charity,” he told the DCNF of Cities4Life. “We are an essential business. We have both a local ordinance, a stay in shelter local ordinance, and a stay in shelter state ordinance.”
 Cities4Life is a publicly recognized charity that provides essential social services — like an ABC store, he said.
 
  North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper on March 27 issued a stay-at-home order in place until April 29, prohibiting gatherings of 10 or more people and directing North Carolinians to stay at home except for essential activities or businesses, such as grocery shopping, outdoor activity, taking care of others, and working at essential businesses like hospitals.
 Local outlets reported that police said there were about 50 people protesting at the clinic, but Benham said that information is inaccurate. Cities4Life had three members present at the clinic and a mobile ultrasound unit attended by two members, according to Benham, while about 15 police officers were at the scene. (RELATED: ‘Hail Satan’: Students Met With Public Masturbation, Glass Hurled, As They Pray Outside Abortion Clinic)
 “By the time they took me away, there were individuals that came and showed up,” he said. “But there was no organized groups of people. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said there was a cluster, that there were 50 protesters. And of course, none of that is true.”
 Video footage from the incident showed Benham telling a police officer that he and Cities4Life are within their rights to stand outside the clinic, adding that they are practicing social distancing and standing six feet apart.
 
 WATCH:
    David Benham Unlawfully Arrested
 Saturday morning David Benham was unlawfully arrested. Many have labeled him a fake Christian and claimed that he was endangering lives by being out today. This couldn't be further from the truth. David practiced social distancing and exercised every necessary precaution in light of COVID-19. Thank you for all the prayer and support so far. See the whole story in this video.
 Posted by Benham Brothers on Saturday, April 4, 2020
 
 “We are practicing social distancing, we have cleaned our hands, we are offering help to these mothers,” Benham told the police officers in the video.
 He told the DCNF that Cities4Life took multiple precautions against the virus, including drawing on the sidewalk to mark appropriate distances for the sidewalk counselors.
 He continued: “And if you are saying that we don’t have the right to be here, then go in the abortion clinic and make the arrests there.”
 “I don’t have the authority to go in the abortion clinic,” the police officer said. (RELATED: World Health Organization: Abortion Is ‘Essential’ During Coronavirus Pandemic)
 “So you don’t have the authority to go into the abortion clinic, but you have the authority to bully us and our sidewalk counselors?” Benham asked the officer.
 “I’m not budging,” he added. “And our sidewalk counselors are not budging.”
 “You know I am well within my constitutional authority to be here,” Benham said, as he was handcuffed. “You know that we are doing the right thing.”
 The video footage showed Benham telling the officers that he and the other sidewalk counselors are acting within their constitutional rights to be there, and that the group is a recognized charity “offering essential services” within the law to assist women in at-risk situations.
 “I’m actually thankful that when I got tapped on the shoulder, I didn’t even hesitate and just did it,” Benham told the DCNF of his arrest. “Then I felt courage inside of me and I felt a real pain in my heart for my country, and I felt a real threat to my children’s future.”
 “And you’ll see on the video, when they cuffed me, I said something and I almost burst out crying. I swallowed it back because I was just hit with such emotion that I can’t believe my country is doing this. I can’t believe these officers,” he said. “And it wasn’t the officers. It’s whoever’s instructing the officers. I can’t believe we’ve gotten to this point where we’re going to use a national healthcare emergency, a global healthcare emergency and global healthcare crisis to grab on unlimited power of the government and steal constitutional rights from pro-life Christians.”
 Benham was booked and released four hours later, he said, with an upcoming court date of June 2. He and seven others were charged with Violation of Emergency Prohibitions and Restrictions, according to WBTV.
 “I was already in jail — just the holding tank — for about an hour. And then all of a sudden I look up and boom, here comes my 20-year-old with cuffs on,” Benham said.
 “I said, ‘What on earth happened?’ He was like, ‘Well, you know, I wasn’t even standing around anyone and they told me I had to leave and there wasn’t even 10 people there.’ And so I was like, ‘Well, I might as well go down and like my dad.'”
 Benham said the incident showed “viewpoint discrimination” from the mayor of Charlotte, the city council members of Charlotte, and the city attorney of Charlotte.
 “They’ve been after us for years,” he said. “Against conservative voices.”
 “So once this coven crisis hit, this was their opportunity for a power grab,” he added.
 Benham pointed the DCNF toward a March 28 tweet from Charlotte City Councilwoman Julie Eiselt in which she asked police to shut down pro-life activity at an abortion clinic. Eiselt, who did not respond to a request for comment from the DCNF, noted in another tweet that pro-lifers had been protesting at a Planned Parenthood clinic.
  Neither Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles nor the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department replied to multiple requests for comment from the DCNF. (RELATED: Texas Governor Deems Religious Services Essential As Police Arrest Southern Pastors For Holding Sunday Services)
 Benham noted that the police understood “very clearly” that Cities4Life had the right to be at the clinic.
 “They had one of their officers on the phone with their attorney,” he said. “And so every argument I was making, they would then make that argument to their attorney and then come back with what they were trying to say. And every time we just twisted them right up and said, ‘Nope, Nope. Doesn’t work. Here’s why.'”
 “They should have never made that arrest,” he added. “They should’ve never done it. But they did.”
 Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz defended Benham in a Saturday tweet, calling the arrest “unconstitutional.”
 “My friend David Benham was unconstitutionally arrested today in NC for peacefully providing pregnancy counseling outside an abortion clinic. If NC deems abortion “essential,” then pregnancy care services are as well. This is WRONG; Governor Cooper should be ashamed,” he tweeted.
 “This is an unconstitutional arrest,” Cruz added in another tweet. “@BenhamBrothers exercising core First Amendment rights. PEACEFULLY. In a way fully consistent w/ public safety. Because elected Dems are pro-abortion, they are abusing their power—in a one-sided way—to silence pregnancy counselors.”
 Both Live Action and Live Action’s president Lila Rose weighed in on the matter as well.
  “It is DESPICABLE  unconstitutional for pro-abortion bureaucrats to order the arrest of peaceful Americans who pray  offer hope outside abortion facilities, all while allowing the lethal abortion industry to continue killing innocent children during a pandemic,” Rose tweeted.

""We've done 1.67 million tests, and we have a great system now,"" Trump told reporters.
The US president added that the overall situation was getting slightly better.
""We see the light at the end of the tunnel. ... Hopefully, in the not-too-distant future we will be proud of the job we all did,"" Trump noted.
New York, which has been the most impacted state by COVID-19, for the first time in a week reported fewer deaths from previous days, although there were 600 new fatal cases.
""Maybe that's a good sign,"" Trump commented.
Over 331,000 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the United States, which is the largest number of cases among all countries. The US death toll from the viral infection is the third largest, it is surpassed only by Italy (over 15,880 deaths) and Spain (more than 12,400 deaths).
Johns Hopkins University data at 13:30 GMT on Sunday showed that the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US was 312,249 including over 8,500 fatalities."

Pence stressed that, as Trump said earlier at the briefing, there was ""light at the end of the tunnel."" ""We'll get through this a lot sooner than we first thought it would take,"" the vice president said.
According to the Johns Hopkins University's Coronavirus Resource Center, there are over 335,500 confirmed coronavirus cases in the US, which is the largest number of COVID-19 cases of all countries.
 The United States has the third largest death toll from COVID-19 in the world (over 9,500 fatalities), it is surpassed only by Italy (over 15,880 deaths) and Spain (more than 12,600 deaths). The city of New York alone has registered over 2,250 deaths from COVID-19.

55	Daily Mail UK	961719	Kellie Chudzinski	Lucy Hale dons a face mask while running errands in Los Angeles	"As the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, continues to see rises in cases and deaths around the country, the Centers for Disease Control has implemented a new recommendation for people to wear face masks during any time in public.

And Lucy Hale seems to be following the new suggestion as she was spotted in a face mask while running errands in Los Angeles on Sunday.

The 30-year-old star looked casual for her outing in green metallic workout leggings paired with a black bomber jacket.

Her black jacket had a large rose embroidered on the back and she paired the look with a dark grey plain tee and black and grey lace-up sneakers.

Keeping her hands free she had a crossbody bag, with a light brown leather strap, across her chest.

The former Pretty Little Liars star covered the rest of her face with dark metal frame sunglasses.

Her signature brunette locks were pulled back, and out of her face, into a low ponytail as she was spotted getting into her white Mercedes SUV.

The animal lover took to Twitter on Thursday in support of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

'An organization I absolutely adore - @ASPCA - is urgently seeking donations for their COVID-19 Relief & Recovery Initiative to help pets, pet owners, and animal welfare organizations!! Please consider supporting their lifesaving efforts,' she tweeted for her roughly 7.1 million followers along with a link to the organization's emergency relief fund.

Lucy has been portraying title character Katy Keene in The CW spin-off of Riverdale since its premiere in February.

The Tennessee native rose to fame portraying Aria Montgomery in the Freeform series Pretty Little Liars from 2010 to 2017.

Lucy had a starring role in the Fantasy Island supernatural horror film that was released on February 14 in theaters.

The prequel to the 1977 ABC television series earned $48 million worldwide against a production budget of $7 million.

Lucy currently has three films in post-production: A Nice Girl Like You, Son Of The South and Big Gold Brick.

She also is a co-producer of A Nice Girl Like You, which is based on the 2007 popular memoir Pornology by Ayn Carrillo-Gailey."

Charlotte Flair won her second NXT Championship tonight.

Fans are already calling the match one of the best of the weekend.









News            



Modified 06 Apr 2020, 05:23 IST









          Ripley vs Flair at WrestleMania 36Following what was an incredible match between the two at WrestleMania 36, Charlotte Flair defeated Rhea Ripley to win her second NXT Women's Championship.
'The Queen' spent most of the match working on Ripley's left knee, and while the 'Nightmare' certainly held her own during the bout, it wasn't enough. Flair won the hard-fought battle following a Figure Eight leglock.
          Image courtesy of WWE This was the opening match on the second night of a two night WrestleMania that has had to improvise left and right due to the lockdowns caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic. This is the reason that tonight's matches have been prerecorded and held in an empty WWE Performance Center - save for a few exceptions like the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House match.
That  being said, Ripley vs Flair was an incredibly well-performed match, with both Superstars attempting to put on a show worthy of a stadium of screaming fans. And that they did, with the majority of opinion expressed on social media sites like Twitter and Facebook expression their joy with the fight, and already calling it one of the best matches of the two nights so far.
In the meantime, we'll have to wait and see what kind of impression Flair makes on NXT now that she's the black and gold brand's reigning women's champion.

1480	Stuff - Press	956248	Hamish Mcneilly	Coronavirus: 'Traumatised' tourist driver sentenced over fatal crash	"Melanie Giesinger, 28, was fined and disqualified from driving after causing the death of motorcyclist Tane Roderick in a crash near Moeraki on Waitangi Day.

A grieving mother says the tourist driver who killed her son ""may not be in jail, but boy she's getting punished"".

Melanie Giesinger, a teacher from Austria, appeared for sentencing behind closed doors in the Auckland District Court on Friday after killing Kiwi motorcyclist Tane Roderick in a crash in Otago on Waitangi Day.

Roderick's family, including his Invercargill-based mother Sally Wast, were able to take part in the sentencing via audio visual link, or telephone.

Roderick, 42, died when the campervan Giesinger was driving pulled out in front of his motorcycle near Moeraki, south of Oamaru, on February 6.

 * Coronavirus: US lobbying for its citizens to be allowed to get to Auckland to fly home

Giesinger, 28, pleaded guilty in February, but her counsel sought a discharge without conviction, delaying her sentencing until April.

The rescheduled sentencing was going to be held in Dunedin on Wednesday, but was brought forward under urgency due to concerns about Covid-19.

Giesinger's travelling companions returned to Austria in February, leaving her to face the sentencing alone.

Her isolation, coupled with New Zealand's coronavirus lockdown and Roderick's death, had left her ""traumatised"", Wast said.

""Mentally it is going to weigh on her the rest of her life. I think she's been punished enough.""

It was unclear when Giesinger could return home, but ""she needs to be with her family"", Wast said.

""I do feel for her, being here on her own, that must be horrendous for her.""

Giesinger and Roderick's family met face-to-face at a restorative justice meeting after the last Dunedin court appearance.

Wast said the family were ""a pretty intimidating lot"" and Giesinger was obviously remorseful.

""She answered the questions we all asked ... after all it could have been any one of us driving that campervan. She just happened to be the one that day.""

Wast said she continued to grieve for her son and his death served as a reminder that ""you never know when your number is up"".

Roderick, who had just celebrated his first wedding anniversary, was travelling to Invercargill for the Burt Munro Challenge Rally after visiting his uncle in Moeraki.

The police summary of facts said the Auckland man died instantly when Giesinger drove her campervan into his path.

Giesinger told police she did not see him.

Wast said Giesinger was fined $4500 at Friday's sentencing, and ordered to pay reparation to Roderick's family. She was also disqualified from driving in New Zealand for 18 months.

It is unclear if Giesinger is able to return home to Austria, but her sentencing comes as neighbouring Germany helps hundreds of its citizens fly home."

On Friday, President Donald Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to use the Defense Production Act to ""accept, perform and prioritize federal contracts"" for ventilators.Trump's move comes after he railed against the automaker on Twitter over the production of the life-saving machines needed to assist medical professionals responding to the coronavirus pandemic.In a statement, the White House accused General Motors of ""wasting time"" and that their fight against the COVID-19 pandemic was too urgent to allow for the give-and-take of the contracting process.GM confirmed that it would build ventilators at a factory in Indiana, in partnership with Ventec Life Systems.The VOCSN critical-care ventilators are FDA-cleared and could begin shipping next month.



""Across all manufacturers, there is a global backorder of critical care ventilators capable of supporting patients fighting COVID-19,"" Ventec said in a statement.""Depending on the needs of the federal government, Ventec and GM are poised to deliver the first ventilators next month and ramp up to a manufacturing capacity of more than 10,000 critical care ventilators per month with the infrastructure and capability to scale further.""Some details about the use of the factory in Indiana were earlier reported by The New York Times.Ventec said that it would also expand manufacturing capacity at its Bothell, Washington, facility.GM and Ventec announced a partnership earlier this week. But on Friday, President Donald Trump attacked GM and CEO Mary Barra for a deal for FEMA to buy ventilators that reportedly fell through.

The source of infection is yet to be traced.”“He had travelled outside Punjab and we are tracking it. We have taken the samples of his family and admitted him to the civil hospital isolation ward late on Saturday night. We will also trace his contacts.”The 26-year-old told the TOI that he visited Guntur district, Vijayawada, Hyderabad, from March 16 to 23 and stayed at an acquaintance’s house there. On March 23, he took a flight from Hyderabad to Delhi and returned to Ludhiana the next day.He denied attending Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi.The deputy commissioner said, “The health department is keeping a check on his family.

(NASDAQ: GILD) is donating 1.5 million doses of remdesivir, its investigational drug for COVID-19, for compassionate use, expanded access and clinical trials, Chairman and CEO Daniel O'Day said Saturday. 
The doses are intended for patients with severe symptoms who will receive them intravenously on a daily basis in a hospital setting, the CEO said in a letter posted on Gilead's website. 
The 1.5 million doses could amount to more than 140,000 treatment courses in COVID-19 patients, depending on the duration of treatment, he said. 
The antiviral drug was first developed by Gilead as a potential treatment for the Ebola and Marburg viruses. Multiple clinical trials for the drug are underway in COVID-19 with thousands of patients worldwide participating, the company's CEO said Saturday. 
The drug is investigational and unapproved, and its safety and efficacy are not yet known, according to Gilead.
""Having a potential treatment in our hands comes with significant responsibility,"" O'Day said. 
""Providing our existing supplies at no charge is the right thing to do, to facilitate access to patients as quickly as possible and in recognition of the public emergency posed by this pandemic.""

Gilead Sets Goal Of Producing 1M More Remdesivir Doses This Year
As of Sunday, there are 1,252,265 confirmed coronavirus cases globally and 68,147 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. 238,675 people have recovered from the virus, according to the university. 
Over 1,700 patients have been treated programs where Gilead has provided remdesivir on a compassionate use basis for children and pregnant women, O'Day said. 
The company has set a goal of producing more than 500,000 remdesivir treatment courses by October and 1 million by the end of 2020.
The production of the drug requires specialized chemistry, multiple chemical reactions, scarce raw materials and sterile manufacturing capabilities, the CEO said. Gilead has managed to cut the end-to-end manufacturing timeline for remdesivir from about one year to roughly six months, he said.

3966	Australian Broadcast Corporation (ABC) News Online	975397		Australia's coronavirus death toll hits 37 as numbers in NSW continue to rise	"Australia's coronavirus death toll has doubled in the past week after two new fatalities in NSW took the national total to 37.

NSW Health confirmed an 86-year-old man and a 85-year-old man with COVID-19 died yesterday.

On March 30 Australia had 17 confirmed coronavirus fatalities, but that number has swollen in the past week.

The increase is particularly pronounced in NSW, where there has been 18 COVID-19 deaths, including six in the past two days.

NSW Health's executive director of protection Dr Jeremy McAnulty said the total number of new cases in the state was decreasing.

In the 24 hours to 8:00pm Sunday, there were 57 new coronavirus infections in NSW, taking the state's total to 2,637.

""The numbers we are seeing in the last few days have been really hopeful,"" Dr McAnulty said.

""It seems that the actions we are taking in terms of case finding and contact tracing have been working.""

Eleven coronavirus deaths, and more than 600 cases, have been linked to the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which docked at Port Kembla this morning.

NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said there were 1,040 crew members from 50 different countries still on the ship.

About a fifth of them have COVID-19 symptoms.

Yesterday, police announced a criminal probe to examine if the ship's operator, Carnival Australia, downplayed potential COVID-19 cases before it docked in Sydney last month.

The ship will get fresh supplies and everyone on board will be tested so healthy crew members can be repatriated.

Dr McAnulty said it was ""pleasing"" to see a drop in the latest infections figures in NSW, but noted there were fewer tests done at the weekend.

There have been more than 300,000 screenings for the virus done across the country.

NSW Health said it was encouraging doctors and clinics to expand their COVID-19 testing in regions where there was evidence of local transmissions.

""So people with symptoms of acute respiratory infection, so cough, shortness of breath, sore throat or fever [should] go talk to their GP or go to a clinic for testing,"" Dr McAnulty said.

He said areas which NSW Health were looking to expand screening in Sydney included Ryde, Macquarie Park, Woollahra, Manly, Waverley and Dee Why.

Outside Sydney, Dr McAnulty said testing should be increased in Byron, Lake Macquarie, Port Macquarie, Broken Hill and Nowra.

Last week, a pop-up testing clinic was established at Bondi Beach after several backpackers were linked to an outbreak in Sydney's eastern suburbs."
700	Times of India	418438		State will use SC breather on border row to formulate effective response: MP | Mangaluru News - Times of India	Mangaluru: A direction from the Supreme Court to the Union health secretary on Friday, to hold consultations with her counterparts in Karnataka and Kerala to find a solution to the deadlock arising from Karnataka’s decision to close its borders and not allow people to enter from Kasaragod, will be heard on April 7, which has given Karnataka a breather for some time. The state will use this time to formulate its response, to negate a direction from the Kerala high court to the Centre in this regard.Asserting there are no issues in this regard till April 7, when the Supreme Court takes up the matter for further hearing, Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel said, “The status quo will continue till then. Karnataka will file one more affidavit before the apex court on that day, explaining reasons on why the borders between Karnataka and Kerala must remain sealed,” putting in context the record number of Covid-19 cases in that state.The Dakshina Kannada district administration is worried as neighbouring Kasaragod district has almost as many Covid-19 cases as is there in the whole of Karnataka.“We have no issues with Kerala in normal times. However, the Covid-19 pandemic has created an extreme situation, where allowing patients from Kasaragod into the city will put tremendous pressure on the existing health infrastructure, that should cater to the needs of people of the district,” Nalin surmised.
8635	Yahoo! Finance News	2265961	Emily Mccormick	Stock market news live updates: Stock futures rise as investors monitor coronavirus case counts	"Stock futures rose Sunday evening as investors braced for another week of closely monitoring developments around the global coronavirus outbreak and policymakers’ responses to the pandemic.
Over the weekend, new coronavirus cases continued to rise in major centers around the world, albeit at an at least temporarily slower pace than in recent weeks.
The state of New York, which leads the nation with about 122,000 positive cases, on Sunday reported 594 new coronavirus deaths, or a decrease from the 630 reported on Saturday. But Governor Andrew Cuomo in Sunday press briefing cautioned against conflating the state’s first reported decrease in both death and total case count with the start of a trend, and reiterated that the state health system remains strained with patients. Total fatalities in New York have topped 4,100 to date.
Elsewhere, Italy reported the slowest rise of new deaths in two weeks on Sunday. France and Spain – two other European centers for the virus – also reported a deceleration in new deaths. In Britain, where more than 47,000 people have been infected, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was admitted to a hospital for further testing 10 days after testing positive for the coronavirus.
Official government guidance around controlling the spread of the coronavirus continues to be dynamic in the U.S., with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday adding a recommendation for Americans to wear cloth face coverings when leaving their homes.
And U.S. leaders’ rhetoric around the outbreak is still dire, with many Americans in states across the country preparing to remain under stay-in-place orders for at least the coming weeks.
On Sunday, U.S. Surgeon General Vice Admiral Jerome Adams told Fox News on Sunday that this coming week “is going to be the hardest and the saddest week of most Americans’ lives, quite frankly,” adding that it will be “our Pearl Harbor moment.” He also noted in the interview, however, that Americans could “change the trajectory of this epidemic” by following social distancing guidelines.
And for equity markets, visibility as to the duration and extent of the outbreak would be a welcomed respite. Stocks ended last week lower as volatility returned to equity markets following the prior week’s advances, as rapidly deteriorating economic data began to reflect the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The March jobs report – which collected data just through about the 12th of the month – already showed U.S. employers cut 701,000 non-farm payrolls, before widespread social distancing measures had even gone into effect.
With this in mind, Thursday’s initial jobless claims report will again be a closely watched print, with consensus economists expecting to see 5 million new unemployment claims filed for the week ended April 4. The prior week, jobless claims skyrocketed to a record 6.648 million.

It is advisable that everyone stays at home and that they do not to venture out aimlessly. It is in the larger interest of society. The drive of seizing vehicles will continue till the lockdown is in force.”Another official from the traffic division revealed that the seizure of vehicle has resulted in less unnecessary movement of motorists.
700	Times of India	418438		No cases in Gurgaon in past five days, but testing curve slopes too | Gurgaon News - Times of India	Gurgaon: The district of Gurgaon may not have reported any novel coronavirus (Covid-19) case in the past five days, but the fact that fewer people have been tested daily since March 18, as revealed by government data, could be a factor.Moreover, only 365 samples have so far been taken in a city that has a population of more than 25 lakh.From a high of 50 people tested on March 21, the number dwindled to 23 on Sunday. The number of people screened at the two civil and 12 private hospitals under government surveillance is a mere 5,974, most of whom were not tested.The number of daily screenings has also declined. On March 18, 19 and 20, the department screened 1,527, 723 and 1,358 people, respectively. From March 26, when only 258 people were screened, the figure dipped to just 30 people on March 27, 26 on March 28 and 49 on March 29.Gurgaon does not have any government testing centres for Covid-19 yet.Even though private players have been roped in by the government, they have to send samples to PGI Rohtak for validation.“Tests are conducted on people with symptoms. Everybody doesn’t need to be tested. People with travel history but no symptoms of Covid-19 are being quarantined,” said JS Punia, CMO.

614	MSNBC	1408276	Thomas Franck	IMF chief Georgieva says the world is in a recession, containment will dictate strength of recovery	"International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva said Friday that the global economy is now in a recession thanks to COVID-19, but that she's heartened to see world leaders finally realizing that only a coordinated effort will be able to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus.

""We have stated that the world is now in recession and that the length and depth of this recession depend on two things: Containing the virus and having an effective, coordinated response to the crisis,"" she told CNBC's Sara Eisen.

""I'm very encouraged by what I see now. I see much clearer understanding [among global leaders] that if we don't beat it everywhere we won't be able to get out of it,"" she added.

""We should not go ... with small measures now when we know that it is a gigantic crisis,"" she said minutes later. ""We've never seen the world economy standing still. Now we [do]. How we go about revitalizing it is another important topic.""

The IMF has taken extraordinary measures in recent weeks to help combat the economic toll COVID-19, and efforts to contain its spread, has had on economies around the globe.

On March 16 the international body said it ""stands ready"" to use its $1 trillion lending capacity to help countries around the world that are struggling with the humanitarian and economic impact of the novel coronavirus.

Georgieva wrote at the time that such support could be used to aid its members, especially emerging and developing countries. The IMF's Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust ""can help the poorest countries with immediate debt relief, which will free up vital resources for health spending, containment, and mitigation.""

Her comments came near the end of yet another violent week on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 down nearly 3% in midday trading in New York. Both the S&P 500 and Dow industrials are up more than 10% this week, however, after the Federal Reserve moved to pump cash into the U.S. economy through historic easing policies and zero-interest loans.

American investors also found relief in moves by Congress toward a massive, $2 trillion stimulus package that, if passed, would provide millions of citizens with quick infusions of cash among other provisions.

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones are each down at least 25% from their all-time highs hit as recently as February.

3966	Australian Broadcast Corporation (ABC) News Online	1558498	Dan Colasimone	Australian doctors design and make medical equipment needed to fight coronavirus	"Australian doctors who are worried the system will not be able to provide them with the equipment they need to protect themselves and their patients during the COVID-19 pandemic are looking at ways to design and produce their own.

Doctors are concerned about the availability of equipment to protect both themselves and patients, one Melbourne anaesthetist, who wished to remain anonymous, told the ABC.

""Many doctors and health professionals are very concerned and confused about the requirements for, and current supply of, personal protective equipment (PPE) for hospitals,"" she said.

""Some hospitals now have less than one week of available stock of this type of equipment to deal with any potential or known COVID-positive patients.

""This situation is applicable to normal or emergency surgery, emergency rooms and inpatient ward care, as well as the treatment of COVID-positive patients.""

A large centralised group involving Victorian university staff, clinicians and manufacturers has been working tirelessly to develop suitable products and to co-ordinate the supply and demand of these essential items, and it has begun to network with other similar groups across Australia and internationally.

They have reached out to philanthropical organisations and local engineers and manufacturers to open up supply lines and found them keen to help.

The PPE items they are working to create in order to reduce the risk to staff and secure their safety include:

On top of the doctors' efforts, a Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) task force has been established to assess this dynamic supply and demand situation, while the Federal Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources has set up a ventilator task force.

All DHHS-supplied equipment needs to be approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA).

The TGA has created a rapid approval process to speed this up for COVID-related equipment.

Con Kolivas, a retired anaesthetist and software engineer who is helping to coordinate one of the groups, said it started as a casual chat between a few people about the lack of ventilators in Italy at the time.

They wondered whether it would be possible for Australia to build some kind of simple ventilator in case of a shortage locally.

""The rate of infection of medical staff in the worst-affected areas overseas is now very high and, to make matters worse, doctors who've been infected at the front line appear to have a higher death rate than people who've caught it in the community,"" he said.

""I and others approached people from different disciplines in industry, medicine, engineering, software and so on about what we could do and found a cohort of people willing to help out.

""After the initial discussion about ventilators, talks turned to things we could manufacture locally and personal protective equipment (PPE) was top of the list.

""Government and health suppliers don't actually give us any of this sort of equipment, so we needed to innovate because there isn't an easy path to find these novel pieces of equipment.""

Emergency physician and intensive care fellow Arun Ilancheran said a severe shortage of equipment was looming.

""Our group feels is it imperative that we source local engineers and manufacturers to continue to have the supply chain of the essential equipment that we need to save lives during this pandemic.

""We are aware that as the lockdown phase gets stricter, we will have further supply chain issues.""

Dr Kolivas said the Victorian Government was keen to support any firm designs the group could come up with, but for any complex designs, the regular government channels of approval and funding could slow things down.

Fortunately, various philanthropical organisations were also very willing to assist, he said.

""With the help of 3D printing it makes it possible to tackle any kind of design we want,"" Dr Kolivas said.

""The problem with 3D printing is it's slow, so it's great for producing the prototypes, but you can't mass produce them if each one takes two hours to print.""

That is where support from local manufacturers comes in.

Dr Kolivas said that, again, there was a desire to help.

Toyota is one example of a company which has offered its design and engineering capabilities to produce equipment on a large scale.

Crucially, Dr Kolivas said, ventilator manufacturer Medtronic had opened up one of its designs for free use during the pandemic, without intellectual property restrictions, meaning there was potential for manufacturers to produce the vital piece of equipment in Australia.

A website, COVID SOS, has been set up as a central hub for the various groups out there working on novel solutions.

It is also trying to address frontline medical equipment shortages through community-sourced methods of design and manufacture.

Here are some examples of the equipment the group is working on:

""The ""intubation box"" is an example of an alternative novel PPE to deal with the unique threat of coronavirus. When a patient is so severely affected by the respiratory complications that they need to be put on a ventilator, they need to have a tube put into their trachea to connect them up to the ventilator. That particular procedure puts the doctor (usually an anaesthetist, intensive care specialist, or emergency physician) and assisting staff in very close proximity with the patient's respiratory tract — they're literally staring down the patient's throat. The potential for aerosol exposure there is extreme, and our clinicians had seen perspex shells used overseas for that scenario to limit that exposure. We developed our own solution, as you can see in the diagram, where the patient is under perspex with rubber-like seals to drop around the patient, and it has self-sealing hand holes for the clinicians to do their intubation. The design was revised and simplified a few times and is made from laser-cut perspex, so is ultimately not that complex to build, which is important. It has been tested clinically with success already and we're looking to produce a number of these for multiple hospitals.""

""The facial shield is a very simple guard to/from the staff member which provides an impermeable barrier to any aerosols being sprayed in either direction. It obviously doesn't provide a perfect airtight seal but it affords a great deal of confidence when performing procedures on infected patients. We were able to prototype these from an open-source design on the internet and 3D print them. 3D printing has allowed us to rapidly get a design built, so it allows for rapid prototyping, but is very slow in production. A local manufacturer has taken up the need for facial shield designs and has said they'll be able to produce them in the thousands. We have been connecting hospital networks with this manufacturer to allow them to test out their prototypes and they should be able to order them immediately."""
8635	Yahoo! Finance News	2432073	James Thornhill And Sharon Cho	Oil Retreats as Meeting Delay Raises Doubts for Price War Truce	"(Bloomberg) -- Crude fell sharply in Asia after a delay to a planned meeting of top producers to discuss output curbs raised doubts over the prospects for an agreement.
Brent futures dropped as much as 12%, after jumping almost 14% on Friday. The OPEC+ bloc including Russia will hold a virtual gathering on April 9 instead of Monday after fresh divisions emerged. Saudi Arabia and Russia have indicated that they want the U.S. to join any agreement, but President Donald Trump had only hostile words for OPEC on Saturday, and threatened tariffs on foreign oil.
State oil producer Saudi Aramco has delayed until Thursday an announcement on its official selling prices for May, according to people with knowledge of the situation, to await signs of what may happen at the meeting. That comes as the International Energy Agency said that the deepest production cuts in the oil industry’s history wouldn’t be enough to steady a crude market in which demand has been ravaged by the coronavirus.
“The likelihood of a deal being done is extremely low,” said Daniel Hynes, senior commodities strategist at ANZ Bank. “Certainly the type of agreement you’d need to stabilize the market is a long shot given how much demand had been hit.”
Brent crude fell $2.14 a barrel to $31.97 at 6:52 a.m. Singapore time after earlier dropping to as low as $30.03. The contract’s six-month contango widened to $5.58 a barrel from $3.96 on Friday.
West Texas Intermediate futures in New York declined 7.3% to $26.28 a barrel after earlier dropping as much as 11%.
Brent futures rallied 37% last week, while WTI ended the week up 32%, as Riyadh and Moscow appeared to move toward a resolution to their damaging battle for market share. Prices are still less than half the levels at the start of the year, with the coronavirus crisis crushing demand.

MORE, the nation's top infectious disease expert, reportedly clashed recently with President Trump Donald John TrumpPelosi eyes end of April to bring a fourth coronavirus relief bill to the floor NBA to contribute 1 million surgical masks to NY essential workers Private equity firm with ties to Kushner asks Trump administration to relax rules on loan program: report MORE's top trade representative Peter Navarro over the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine and its use as a possible treatment for COVID-19.

During a meeting Saturday first reported by Axios, Navarro reportedly accused Fauci of opposing the administration's temporary ban on travel from China after Fauci cautioned against the administration promoting the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus.

""You were the one who early on objected to the travel restrictions with China,"" Navarro reportedly told Fauci.

There's no evidence Fauci has ever publicly criticized the administration's approach to travel from China amid the outbreak, and on March 12 Fauci praised such a policy during a press briefing.

Trump officials including the president himself have touted the possibility of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for coronavirus, though the drug is not proven to be effective according to Fauci himself during a recent press conference.

""The answer is no,"" he said in late March, adding: ""And the evidence that you're talking about ... is anecdotal evidence.""

""There has never been a confrontation in the task force meetings like the one yesterday,"" one source familiar with Fauci and Navarro's dispute told Axios. ""People speak up and there's robust debate, but there's never been a confrontation. Yesterday was the first confrontation.""

The White House did not immediately return a request for comment on the exchange from The Hill.

Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have topped 300,000 as of the latest numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)."
1932	CTV News	1055931	Emad Agahi	Surrey should delay its police transition due to outbreak, city councillor says	"SURREY -- 
	Surrey city councillor Linda Annis was against the transition to a municipal police force before the COVID-19 outbreak. Now, she says, she’s even more concerned.


	“We’re in a crisis right now in B.C., Canada and throughout the world,” Annis said. “This not the time for us to be changing badges for the sake of changing badges.”


	Annis points to the economic hardship many people in Surrey and other Lower Mainland municipalities are dealing with right now, with business closing down and laying off employees.


	The City of Surrey itself has temporarily let go of 140 full-time staff members at Surrey libraries.


	“People are unemployed, worrying about rent, mortgage payments and something as simple as putting food on the table for their families,” Annis added.


	She said the city needs to be focusing on providing that kind of service to people now, not focusing on the transition to a new police force.


	Surrey mayor Doug McCallum’s plan is to have the force running by this time next year, at a cost of $192-million in its first 12 months.


	On Sunday, the city said it needed more time before it could officially announce whether COVID-19 would impact the transition, but a Surrey resident shared an email with CTV News that hinted a possible response.


	The email, signed by the Surrey Policing Transition Team and dated March 17, reads, in part, “at this time there is no impact from COVID-19 on the delivery of the policing transition project.”


	The provincial government also said it needed more time to provide a comment on where it stands in regard to a possible delay in the Surrey police transition because of COVID-19.


	Meanwhile, Annis said she will continue to call on the province to order a referendum on the transition."

466	News	942911	Log In	Year 12 could be extended into next year in the wake of coronavirus	"Education ministers are looking at every trick in the book to ensure year 12 students finish school this year despite the mayhem caused by coronavirus. 
Concerns have been raised about how the disruption caused by COVID-19 could damage year 12 results.
State and federal ministers will meet on Tuesday to canvass options including extending the academic year or postponing final exams. They will also discuss boosting overall scores and changing university application procedures.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has floated the possibility of extending year 12 into next year - a year 13, but his federal counterpart is not keen.
“All options will be considered tomorrow when we meet – that is an outlier option – that is in a very worst case scenario,” Federal Education Minister Dan Tehan told Seven on Monday.
“The hope is that we will be able to get everyone through this year.”
State and territory curriculum and assessment authorities will present all available options to the meeting.
Mr Tehan said responses to the pandemic would likely vary between jurisdictions.
“But there is a collective will among all education ministers for us to be able to ensure that all those year 12 students will be able to complete their studies this year,” he said.
“And then go on to university, vocational education or employment next year.”

""We can cover four to five times more distance using drones than a human can do in a day,"" said Agnishwar Jayaprakash, founder of Garuda Aerospace, which has deployed drones in Raipur in Chhattisgarh, and Namakkal and Tiruvarur in Tamil Nadu.""The drones can reach heights of up to 100 metres and cover more area. We can automate 80% of the spraying without human intervention"".One of the biggest and easiest use cases for drones is surveillance. ""It's not just a flying CCTV camera, it's a flying CCTV camera with an operator. This way, the operators can specifically tell the authorities if there is a problem in an area or not,"" said Smit Shah, director of partnerships at The Drone Federation of India. The organisation is utilising its base of drone operators and putting them in touch with local authorities, he added. In Tamil Nadu, the state electricity board, TN Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) has deployed drones to sanitise around 25 sub-stations as a pilot to deal with the spread of the virus.Bengaluru-based IIO Technologies has also deployed drones for crowd control and to monitor the body temperature of people in several locations in Delhi. In Bengaluru, the firm has deployed its drones in HSR Layout and operations in a few other areas are ongoing.

""On the advice of his doctor, the Prime Minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests,"" the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement.
The decision to go to the hospital was described as a ""precautionary step.""
""Prime Minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after testing positive for the virus,"" Downing Street explained in a statement, Sunday. ""The Prime Minister thanks NHS staff for all of their incredible hard work and urges the public to continue to follow the Government's advice to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.""

CNN's Medical Analyst Dr. Kent Sepkowitz says that the tests Johnson will receive could reveal ""several more variables of lung function and might indicate whether he is just fatigued and spent, or actually in some danger."" 
In the time since his diagnosis, Johnson has worked from home and lived in accordance with social distancing guidelines.
On Friday, Johnson released an update video on Twitter saying he was still experiencing symptoms: ""I still have a temperature. So in accordance with government advice I must continue my self-isolation until that symptom itself goes.""

27	Reuters	990533	Guy Faulconbridge	Boris Johnson hospitalised for tests after persistent coronavirus symptoms	"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital for tests on Sunday after suffering persistent coronavirus symptoms 10 days after testing positive for the virus, though Downing Street said he remained in charge of the government. 
Johnson, who was isolating in Downing Street after testing positive last month, still had a high temperature and so his doctors felt he should go to an undisclosed hospital for tests in what the government said was a “precautionary step”. 
“On the advice of his doctor, the prime minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests,” his Downing Street office said in a statement. Johnson is expected to stay overnight.  
“This is a precautionary step, as the prime minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus ten days after testing positive for the virus,” the statement added. 
News of his hospitalisation came only after an hour after Queen Elizabeth delivered a rallying call to the British public saying they would overcome the coronavirus outbreak if they stayed resolute. 
Johnson, 55, on March 27 became the first leader of a major power to announce that he had tested positive. He went into isolation at an apartment in Downing Street and said on Friday he was staying there as he still had a high temperature. 
Downing Street underscored that this was not an emergency admission and that Johnson remained in charge of the government. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will chair the government’s emergency COVID-19 meeting on Monday, a source said. 
With only an unwieldy collection of sometimes ancient and contradictory precedents to go by, there is no simple, formally-enshrined “Plan B” or succession scenario should the prime minister become incapacitated. 
The pound briefly fell 0.4% vs the U.S. dollar to $1.2215 before trimming some losses to trade at $1.2230, down 0.3%. 
Queen Elizabeth had been informed of Johnson’s admission to hospital, Buckingham Palace said. It made no further comment. 
U.S. President Donald Trump said Johnson was a “strong man” as he passed on his nation’s best wishes. 
“All Americans are praying for him,” Trump told a news conference. “He’s a friend of mine, he’s a great gentleman and a great leader, and as you know he went to the hospital today but I’m hopeful and sure that he’s going to be fine.” 
CORONAVIRUS IN THE UK 
Johnson, the face of the 2016 Brexit campaign, won a resounding election victory in December before leading the United Kingdom out of the European Union on Jan. 31. 
But he has faced criticism in the United Kingdom for initially approving a much more modest response to the novel coronavirus outbreak than other major European leaders, telling a news conference on March 3 that he had been shaking hands with coronavirus patients. 
He then changed tack when scientific projections showed a quarter of a million people could die in the United Kingdom. 
Johnson effectively shuttered the world’s fifth-largest economy, advising people to stay at home and the elderly or infirm to isolate themselves for weeks. 
But the virus has penetrated the British government.  
Johnson and his health minister tested positive last month and his chief medical adviser also self isolated. Johnson’s pregnant 32-year-old fiancee, Carrie Symonds, also had symptoms but said on Saturday she was feeling better. 
From an apartment above Number 11 Downing Street, and with food brought to his door, Johnson continued to lead the government’s response and chaired meetings via video conference. 
He has posted a series of video messages on Twitter since then, initially appearing in a suit and tie but in the latest post on Friday, he appeared weary, sitting in a chair with his shirt open at the neck.  
“Although I’m feeling better and I’ve done my seven days of isolation, alas I still have one of the symptoms, a minor symptom, I still have a temperature,” he said. 
Britain’s National Health Service guidelines stipulate that those who suspect they have coronavirus should not leave home. 
Under a section headlined “What to do if you need medical help while self-isolating”, it says: “If you need medical help for any reason, do not go to places like a GP (family doctor) surgery, pharmacy or hospital.”  
Health officials said on Sunday the UK death toll from the coronavirus had risen by 621 to 4,934.  
Downing Street refused to say what tests Johnson was to have in hospital, but experts said a person of the prime minister’s age with COVID-19 symptoms after 10 days would be likely be  assessed for their oxygen levels, lung, liver and heart functions, and undergo an electrocardiogram heart check. 
Doctors managing COVID-19 patients had reported that more men than women had serious problems and patients who were overweight or had previous health issues were at a higher risk. 
Earlier this year, Johnson said he needed to lose weight.

“We don’t know exactly why the PM has gone to hospital except we have been told he is having tests,” said Derek Hill, professor of medical imaging science at University College London. 
“Many people attending hospital with COVID-19 have difficulty breathing. Some people are rapidly discharged. Some others can quickly deteriorate and need help breathing. We have no reason to believe the PM needs such help.”

In a Twitter video, Cook outlined Apple’s efforts to assist the heroic healthcare professionals on the frontlines fighting the coronavirus pandemic.



The first shipment of face shields went to Kaiser facilities in the Santa Clara Valley earlier this week, Cook said. Apple said that by the end of this coming week, it will have shipped over one million face shields and will ship another million the week after.

Apple is working with governments at all levels in a “truly global effort” to get the over 20 million sourced masks to places of the greatest need, Cook said. He added that teams across Apple, such as design, operations, engineering and packaging, are working with suppliers to produce and ship face shields to hospitals.

The materials for the masks and face shields are being sourced from the U.S. and China, where they are also being manufactured. “We hope to quickly expand distribution beyond the U.S.” Cook said.

1315	Newsweek	953313	Christina Zhao	"Trump hits back at Illinois Gov. Pritzker for ""complaining all the time"" during coronavirus briefing: ""He hasn't performed well"""	"President Donald Trump fired back at Democratic Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker for allegedly ""complaining all the time"" during Sunday's coronavirus White House press briefing, adding that he ""hasn't performed well"" amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

""There is a governor, I hear him complaining all the time, Pritzker. He is always complaining,"" Trump said after taking the podium. ""I just said, 'give me a list of a couple of the things we've done in Illinois.' We're building a 2,500-bed hospital in McCormick Place, that's a big convention center in Chicago. We're helping to staff it and probably will end up staffing it because he's not able to do what he's supposed to be able to do as the governor.""

""He has not performed well,"" the president added.

Newsweek reached out to the White House for comment.

Trump's criticism of Pritzker came hours after the Illinois governor called out the president on CNN's State of the Union for suggesting that states should have prepared their own stockpiles of medical equipment.

""The president does not understand the word federal. Federal Emergency Management Agency. We have a state Emergency Management Agency, but if he were right, why would we ever need a Federal Emergency Management Agency?"" Pritzker said. ""It's because individual states can't possibly do what the federal government can do.""

Trump said some U.S. states were ""totally unprepared"" for the coronavirus pandemic during the White House' COVID-19 press conference on Friday. ""We have a federal stockpile, and they have state stockpiles, and frankly they were, many of the states, they were totally unprepared for this,"" the president said. ""So we had to go into the federal stockpile, but we're not an ordering clerk. They have to have it for themselves.""

In response, Pritzner told CNN that individual states did not have the power to invoke the Defense Production Act that would have allowed them to prepare for such a pandemic, but noted that the Trump administration did.

""There's no way that we can stockpile in anticipation of a pandemic that no one anticipated, and yet the federal government is responsible for doing precisely that,"" the Illinois governor said. ""And we now know that intelligence sources and all the best advice that was given, was given in January and early February to the president and the White House, and they seemed to not have acted at all upon it.""

Prizker also said that if the Trump administration and federal government had invoked the legislation to build ventilators beforehand, then ""we would to have the same problems we have today, and frankly, very many fewer people would die."""

A Northland man facing charges including breaching the coronavirus lockdown will be spending at least 10 days in prison.

Trevor Roy Hutuwi Thompson was charged with failing to comply with the Civil Defence Act, disorderly behaviour and resisting arrest.

The charges relate to an incident in the Whangārei suburb of Hikurangi on Saturday, where is was claimed he intentionally failed to stop having close contact with people he does not live with.

The 33-year-old from Hikurangi appeared briefly at Whangārei District Court on Monday and told Judge Greg Davis he did not understand what was going on.

Judge Davis' response was swift: ""I would've stayed at home and not breached it [the civil defence legislation].""

Thompson's reply - ""I'll do that now"" - held no sway with the judge, who remanded him in custody until April 15.

The charges come after police released updated guidelines around Alert Level 4 rules, providing clarity about what is acceptable bubble behaviour.

The rules were set out in a Health Notice issued by the Director General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield.

Kiwi Property said with the inherent uncertainty surrounding the length of Covid-19's disruption, the company's board decided it need to be prudent with its capital and would not go ahead with the final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2020.

The final dividend was to have been 3.525 cents a share, worth $55.3m to 11,000 shareholders, but will not longer be paid out to them.

The board of directors, chief executive and executive team had agreed to a 20 percent reduction in pay, while in parallel, employee salary increases had also been frozen.

It was too early to say how much of an impact Covid-19 would have on the company's future income, the value of its properties and on cashflows.

But the impact would be ""material"" the company said. Kiwi also has office buildings in its large portfolio of properties, about 70 per cent of which are in Auckland.

A week ago the company also announced it would lose about $6 million in rental revenue from tenants entitled to rental relief in the tenancy leases.

""It is clear the pandemic will have a material impact on the company's forward-looking performance and rental receipts.

 2. She loves cuddles with everyone in the household

 3. When she gets sick of us, she goes to the other end of the house to have some quiet time

 4. She likes to lie in the sun

A Scottish man who made a last-minute decision to stay in New Zealand for lockdown is calling for compassion and help for stranded travellers.

Glaswegian Paul Mara set up a Facebook group to help travellers find lockdown accommodation. While some have found Airbnbs or are isolating in hostel bubbles, others are in vulnerable situations, he said.

""Normally when you are trying to find somewhere to stay you have time to suss out the place and the person, but people just didn't have that opportunity.

""I've travelled for four years around the world, and I feel the acute pain a lot of people are feeling. Most just want to go home.""

Mara arrived in New Zealand three months ago to travel and contemplate a permanent move here. He was heading to Wanaka when he got word of the lockdown and turned north, intending to head to Auckland.

When he heard about gridlock in Picton and others spending thousands on flights that were later cancelled, he found an Airbnb in Mapua.

Mara was disappointed by social media backlash against travellers, with people saying they should have been better prepared.

""People post saying, follow the rules or f*** off home. Not cool. Human rights still apply even in a crisis.""

Few could have foretold the extent of the crisis ahead, he said.

""It was an unprecedented situation so people have nothing to refer it to. A lot of people had to make very big decisions with little information in just two days.""

Mara found statistics showing that as of late March, there were up to 260,000 overseas visitors in New Zealand.

""That shows you just how tricky it was for everyone to try and figure out how to get home.""

On Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters announced that travellers able to get a ticket would be able to make a ""safe, orderly exit"" out of the country.

""It is clear that many foreign nationals travelling here do not have the resources or capability to adequately self-isolate, and wish to return home.""

For Mara, making the decision to stay was difficult.

""Being away from loved ones, not knowing how long you might be stuck. Also, you feel safer at home; there's that sense of security.""

Travellers, including Kiwis, and people accommodation can contact Mara through his Facebook group, COVID-19 HELP - South Island (New Zealand).

Mara also called for understanding. ""My upbringing taught me to try and help out. It's an unnerving situation for all, but if we have the opportunity to help, we should try.""

Bottom Line: Every pricing strategy is going through a hard reset from the pandemics’ economic fallout, making data-driven decisions a must-have going forward, starting with stabilizing pricing and margins.
 
Data is the best antidote against fear and panic. It provides guardrails, guidance, and insights that lead to better decision-making and, in the case of pricing, preserving margins. Manufacturers surviving in the chaotic wake of COVID-19’s economic impact began modeling worst-case pricing and volume scenarios in early February. Every one of them began deconstructing their sales pipelines, order backlogs, and negotiating for new order delivery dates, doing the best they can with the applications and tools they have. Of all the levers a company can use to stay profitable, pricing is by far the most powerful. A recent McKinsey study found that a 1% price increase yields a 22% increase in Earnings before Interest  Taxes (EBITDA) margins for distribution-based businesses. The same study found it would take a 7.5% reduction in fixed costs to achieve the corresponding 22% increase in EBITDA that a 1% increase in pricing delivers. The more integrated accounting, finance, production, sales, and service data, the better the pipeline, backlog, order, margin, and revenue decisions every business will be able to make. The more effective the commercial analytics, deal intelligence, and deal price guarantee applications, the more they’re able to choose the best possible pricing strategy during chaotic times.
 
Intelligent Pricing Protects Margins In A Downturn 
 
Being data-driven through a crisis helps alleviate risk, demystifies what the actual revenue and order forecasts are, all leading to fewer pricing missteps in uncertain times. The better the data, the more precise projections of downside risk. Using advanced predictive analytics and machine learning, intelligent pricing can deliver commercial analytics, deal price guidance, and deal intelligence. Think of these three areas of commercial intelligence as part of an intelligence pricing engine continually and dynamically always testing and learning through the use of supervised machine learning algorithms. McKinsey’s recent article, Dynamic pricing: Using digital and analytics to take value pricing in the chemical industry to the next level, provides a framework that illustrates why intelligent pricing is needed today. And while the framework is in a chemical industry-oriented article, its core concepts apply to manufacturing.

Preserving margins and enough profit to keep operating during the pandemic requires an entirely new approach to pricing. Knowing in real-time how supplier costs, delays, and unforeseen events impact revenue is a must-have now. Real-time data integration and the speed it delivers is a must-have feature of any pricing system to take on and overcome the many challenges this pandemic has created. Having an intelligent pricing strategy that can quickly interpret, recommend, and act on pricing and margin insights will save more companies in this pandemic than the severest price cuts ever will. 
 
 
The ideal intelligent pricing system would support real-time integration to ERP, CRM, pricing, and service systems and be built on a solid price management, dynamic pricing, and discount and rebate management platform. Personalizing offers and quoting via machine learning would need to be available across every selling and service channel.

What Matters Most When Pricing In A Pandemic 
 
Realize everyone is dealing with a hard revenue reset right now, and the need for demystifying sales pipelines, orders, and backlog is shared across nearly every business affected by the pandemic. After speaking with almost a dozen U.S.-based manufacturers over the last week to see how the pandemic is impacting their business, I learned the following:
 
 
 
 Set hard price floors for customers, segments, by SKU (Stocking Unit), vendor, product collection, and segment. Weighing transaction speed or the time it takes to release a sales hold on a price quote versus margin leakage needs to be considered when hard price floors are set. It’s also a good idea to define eligibility flags which customer, product, vendor, or segment prices are eligible for price exceptions that are sent to sales and senior management for approval. 
 
 Price wars waste margins, and do you want a customer who only buys on price anyway? It’s time to quit any deal where there’s a price war going on now and save the margin. Besides, if you’re quoting to a customer who wants to drive your price to the floor or lower, would you take their business in better times? No. Let them go to competitors who are willing to sacrifice margin. 
 
 Support the five most-proven sales strategies emerging out of this pandemic with more flexible pricing to match how your customers want to buy. Cross-sell, upsell, renewals, win back, and new customers are the five most proven selling strategies during the pandemic based on last months’ manufacturing sales. When defining cross-sell and upsell sales strategies, taking into account how offers and pricing can be personalized to the offer level is proving effective today. Bundling in services and transitioning win-backs to subscription-based models that may be more affordable today is also working. New customer wins are still happening, driven by improved deal pricing guidance.
 
 Using Configure, Price, Quote (CPQ) as a single console for managing pricing while achieving greater enforcement and guidance is a must-do in these times. Achieving greater pricing enforcement and guidance across all sales channels starts with CPQ being the central hub or reference system for price execution. It’s easier to manage product mix decisions and personalize pricing offers by customer, segment, channel, and product. It’s also an excellent way to get warnings or alerts of potential churn and risk detection by customer of low purchasing – all invaluable data to have during a pandemic."

“It’s time to have a really simple message: the masks are useful,” said Meili in a video conference, Sunday.
“The evidence has moved more and more in that direction and I think we’re more at a place where I’m comfortable saying, ‘yes, it’s a good idea for people who are able, and who want to do this, put on a mask that will do more good than harm.’”
Meili made his mask from household products including rubber bands, paper towels and cotton cloth.
But federal health officials say the public should use caution when considering the use of homemade masks, as they can provide a false sense of security for those not ill.

	“If you are a healthy individual, the use of a mask is not recommended for preventing the spread of COVID-19,” says the Public Health Agency of Canada in their guidance on preventing the virus.
Public Health says there can be added risks when making homemade masks. For example, it can increase the risk of infection with improper use and disposal, plus it can encourage people to touch their faces more — the opposite of what needs to be happening.
However, Canadian guidelines contravene what other health agencies across the world are doing.

		In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is recommending Americans wear a cloth or fabric mask to help combat the spread of COVID-19.
	
	In Europe, the Czech Republic, Austria and Slovakia have made it mandatory to wear masks. And in Asia, China and South Korea strongly recommend the use of them.
Even the director-general of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said the biggest mistake western countries have made is people aren’t wearing masks.
“This virus is transmitted by droplets and close contact,” said George Gao, to Science Magazine. “If they are wearing face masks, it can prevent droplets that carry the virus from escaping and infecting others.”

	On Saturday, Canada’s chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said masks can serve a purpose.
After previously stating Canada won’t change its guidelines on masks, Dr. Tam said homemade masks can be a good alternative to those who can’t keep a two-metre distance, like being on a bus with others.
“We’ve been getting mixed messages over the last week since this has developed,” Meili said. “Some folks are saying ‘yes’, some say ‘no.’
“As we look at the science as we know it today, there is a role for the wearing of personal masks, and protecting yourself and protecting those around you.”
One guideline the Public Health Agency and Meili can agree on: leave the healthcare masks to healthcare workers, and make your own at home.
Canada’s guidelines on masks can be read in its entirety online.

Questions about COVID-19? Here are some things you need to know:
Health officials caution against all international travel. Returning travellers are legally obligated to self-isolate for 14 days, beginning March 26, in case they develop symptoms and to prevent spreading the virus to others. Some provinces and territories have also implemented additional recommendations or enforcement measures to ensure those returning to the area self-isolate.

	Symptoms can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing — very similar to a cold or flu. Some people can develop a more severe illness. People most at risk of this include older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. If you develop symptoms, contact public health authorities.
To prevent the virus from spreading, experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve. They also recommend minimizing contact with others staying home as much as possible and maintaining a distance of two metres from other people if you go out.

“This is such a great big deal for us because we’re used to having birthday parties like everyone else and having friends and family over,” she explained.
“It’s hard to tell your children, ‘Sorry, not this year because there’s something scary out there that could harm all of us. In order to keep us all safe, we have to self distance and there will be no party.'”
Her son Riley Mitchell, who is turning 12, said celebrating his birthday this way means a lot.
“I wasn’t expecting that [many] people. It was really cool,” he said.

""On Friday, he has been put under quarantine at Rama Medical college as a precautionary measure,"" said senior health official.CHC medical superintendent further stated that one should understand that this is not a luxury retreat, but this is a quarantine facility.Meanwhile, a man was booked for selling `gutkha' from his outlet in Gilish Bazar area under the limits of Kotwali police station on Sunday. ""The incident came to light after some local posted a video of the shopkeeper selling gutkha from his outlet in Gilish bazar area.

131	CNBC	954405	Eustance Huang	Asia Pacific set to trade mixed; oil prices drop as OPEC and its allies delay meeting	"Stocks in Asia Pacific were set to trade mixed on Monday as a scheduled meeting between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, initially set to take place later today, was delayed.

Futures pointed to a mixed open for Japanese stocks. The Nikkei futures contract in Chicago was at 18,110 while its counterpart in Osaka was at 17,700. That compared against the Nikkei 225's last close at 17,820.19.

Meanwhile, shares in Australia were set to open little changed. The SPI futures contract was at 5,079, as compared to the S&P/ASX 200's last close at 5,067.50.

Markets in China are closed on Monday for Qingming, a tomb sweeping festival.

Investor focus on Monday will likely be on oil prices after a scheduled meeting between OPEC and its allies — collectively referred to as OPEC+ — was pushed back, raising fears that a production cut might face challenges.

Oil prices plunged in the morning of Asian hours, with international benchmark Brent crude futures down 6.3% to $31.96 per barrel. U.S. crude futures also dropped 7.7% to $26.15 per barrel.

The moves came after both Brent and U.S. crude futures surged last week to their best week on record as Saudi Arabia called for a OPEC+ meeting, signalling there could be progress on a production cut. But tensions between Saudi Arabia and Russia escalated on Friday, and the meeting will now ""likely"" be held on Thursday, according to sources familiar with the matter.

The organization's March meeting ended with no deal after Russia rejected Riyadh's proposed output cut that had been made in a bid to prop up falling oil prices as the coronavirus outbreak sapped demand. This kicked off a price war between the two powerhouse producers."

“Bobcaygeon has such great residents here that will do whatever it takes to do what they can for this community. As a resident I need to be a part of that,” explains Richard Kyle, a guitarist with The Tragically Hits — a cover band of The Hip that formed in 2015.
In an effort to show that support, Kyle started an online campaign encouraging Canadians from coast to coast to join in and sing ‘Bobcaygeon’ by The Tragically Hip Sunday evening. The idea was inspired after he saw a social media post of a Montreal comedian who sung the Hip’s song ‘Courage’.
“Sing Bobcaygeon to show your solidarity with the town and the feeling this town brings,” added Kyle.

The community has set up a fund that has raised more than $30,000 to help those impacted by the tragedy. The Bobcaygeon COVID-19 Relief Fund was launched to support Bobcaygeon and area patients, families and health-care workers in need of financial assistance, food supplies, transportation, technology and mental wellness counselling.

“We need the unity and music brings everyone together and it makes everyone happier.”

Andrew Cuomo said Sunday as overall fatalities in the state climbed to nearly 4,200.
Cuomo said it was too soon to determine whether the pandemic had reached its apex.
“We could either be very near the apex, or the apex could be a plateau and we could be on the plateau right now,” Cuomo said. “You can’t do this day to day. You have to look at three or four days to see a pattern.”
The state reported 594 new coronavirus deaths on Sunday — a small decrease compared to the 630 new fatalities announced the day before. ICU admissions and intubations were also down, the governor said, while the discharge rate from hospitals was rising.

	Later in the evening, New York City officials also reported a dip in fatalities. As of 4:45 p.m. it said deaths had risen by 218 since the evening before, to a total of 2,472. By comparison, there were 387 new deaths reported in the previous 24 hours and 305 the day before that.

Cuomo sounded cautiously optimistic even as he urged New Yorkers to remain vigilant and continue adhering to the strict social distancing policies in place.
“The coronavirus is truly vicious,” he said. “It’s an effective killer. People who are very vulnerable must stay isolated and protected.”
New Yorkers hunkered down Sunday as the city entered what authorities called a critical phase of the crisis. Those venturing outdoors for groceries or exercise largely heeded the city’s new guidance to wear face coverings such as scarves or bandannas — a sight far less common a week ago.
Mayor Bill de Blasio also found cause for encouragement, telling reporters that while the city still needs thousands more ventilators, its supply had outlasted earlier projections. Like Cuomo, he stopped short of declaring a turning point in the crisis.

				Coronavirus outbreak: Cuomo would ‘welcome’ Trump to New York amid COVID-19 pandemic
			
							
Here are the latest coronavirus developments in New York:
	
	HEALTH CARE CHALLENGES
The governor said the state’s health care system remained over capacity, adding New York is “running short on supplies all across the board.” More than 122,000 people have tested positive for the coronavirus and at least 16,000 people remain hospitalized.
“The operational challenge for the health care system is impossible,” Cuomo said. “It’s not an exercise. It’s not a drill. It’s a statement of reality.”
The federal government was deploying 1,000 doctors, nurses and respiratory technicians to New York, including 325 scheduled to begin arriving in New York City as early as Sunday.
The statewide balance of coronavirus cases has been “relatively stable” over the past few days, Cuomo said, but officials were tracking what they called a shift to Long Island. Nassau and Suffolk counties together have more than 26,000 cases.
MORE MEDICS REQUESTED
De Blasio reiterated his call Sunday for a federal enlistment of health care workers, warning of a “huge surge in these coming days” that could cripple the city’s already strained hospital system.

	Some 300 military medical personnel were arriving in New York, an infusion the mayor called a good start. He has asked for about 1,450.
“Right now there’s a peacetime approach in Washington,” de Blasio said, “and that won’t cut it.”
SPRING BREAK SCRAPPED
The city cancelled all of spring break for its public schools and, in a controversial reversal, called for classes to be held on the start of Passover and Good Friday. School officials announced the decision Friday, saying it was important to keep remote learning uninterrupted.
The announcement roiled the city’s teachers union.

327	Business Standard	1149253	Capital Market	Power ministry approves 3 months moratorium on Discoms to make payment to Gencos and transmission licensees	"Payment security to be reduced by 50%

Due to the lockdown, consumers are unable to pay their dues to the Distribution Companies (Discoms). This has affected the liquidity position of the Discoms thereby impairing their ability to pay to the generating and transmission companies. In this context, R.K.Singh, the Union Minister of Power has approved significant relief measures for power sector .The following decisions have been taken to ease the liquidity problems of the Discoms:

- CPSU Generation / Transmission Companies will continue supply/ transmission of electricity even to Discoms which have large outstanding dues to the Generation / Transmission companies. During the present emergency there will be no curtailment of supply to any DISCOM.

- Till 30 June 2020 the payment security mechanism to be maintained by the Distribution Companies with the Generating Companies for dispatch of power shall be reduced by fifty percent.

- Directions have been issued to the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission to provide a moratorium of three months to Discoms to make payments to generating companies and transmission licensees and not to levy penal rates of late payment surcharge. State Governments are being requested to issue similar directions to State Electricity Regulatory Commissions.

Despite the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of the COVID 19 pandemic, the whole workforce of the power sector - generation, transmission, distribution and system operations - is working round the clock to keep all homes and establishments lighted. R.K.Singh, the Union Minister of Power, has said that in this time of crisis, the Ministry of Power is committed to provide 24x7 supply of electricity to all consumers.

Around 70% of power generation is from coal based power plants. In order to maintain the continuity of supply of coal by domestic coal companies and transportation by railways, the ministry is in touch with the Ministries of Railways and Coal."

	“Over this week, I’m sure we’ve received easily over 100 calls,” said Ron Swan, executive director of the Family Resource Centre, which helps families and children dealing with behavioural issues.
Many of those calling are parents working from home, now living full-time with kids who are home from school. D.D.O. resident Brian Gutenplan has been living under one roof with five kids, his wife and a dog.
“Ron has been very good at giving some tips and keeping everyone calm,” Gutenplan explained.
“The struggle of the new isolation because of the crisis is causing issues for parents that are not accustomed to being around their children full time and they just need to know someone is there to listen and lend a hand,” said Swan.

The organization, which offers its services for free, nearly closed down last year due to a lack of funding. However, a last-minute donation from a corporate sponsor was received.
“It was actually after the 11th hour we got a donation from a corporate sponsor that allowed us to keep servicing the population at large for at least another six to seven months,” said Swan.
He said one caller this week was a mother stuck in a bathroom not sure what to do because her son was having a tantrum, and that she needed to be “redirected” before she could redirect her son.
Local MNA Carlos Leitao recently shared with his network that the resource center is still open.
“Resources offered by the Family Resource Centre are more important than ever,” he told Global News.

	Though they specialize in younger kids, Swan says nobody who calls will be denied help.

“When our kids have kids, they’ll be reading about this in the textbooks in history,” said Gutenplan.
“I doubt Ron will be mentioned, but organizations like Family Resource Centre will be spoken about because they help so many people.”
If you or your family need help with behavioural issues, the Family Resource Centre number is 514-676-7775.

“He wasn’t sure if he should take her to the hospital because he was afraid of her exposure in the hospital itself.”

		Coverage for online health care is mixed across the country, with a handful of provinces, including B.C., Ontario and Quebec, currently paying for some of the services.
“Just because everyone has to isolate doesn’t mean that day-to-day health care problems go away,” Bryce said.
“People still have ear infections, they still have rashes, they still have UTIs.”

		Dr. Brett Belchetz co-founded Maple about five years ago and serves as CEO. At the time, he said its main value proposition was to help patients avoid wait times and the inconvenience of waiting rooms.
Now, however, concerns around infection have come to the forefront.
“For those needs that aren’t infections, we certainly shouldn’t be putting them in the same waiting room as those patients that are potentially infected with highly-infectious agents like the flu or like COVID-19,” he said.

Shoppers Drug Mart stated it would pay for any costs not covered by provincial governments until Friday.

Johnson, 55, ""continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus"", a Downing Street spokesperson said on Sunday.

His hospitalisation was described as a ""precautionary step"" taken on the advice of his doctor.

On the advice of his doctor, the Prime Minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests. This is a precautionary step, as the Prime Minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus ten days after testing positive for the virus,"" the spokesperson said.

The Prime Minister thanks NHS staff for all of their incredible hard work and urges the public to continue to follow the Government's advice to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives, the spokesperson added.

Johnson had extended self-isolation as he gave an update on his health via social media on Friday, which should have marked the end of the stipulated seven-day self-isolation period after his COVID-19 diagnosis last week.

He said he still has a temperature, one of the symptoms associated with coronavirus, and would therefore have to stay in isolation for longer.

""Although I'm feeling better and I've done my seven days of isolation, alas I still have one of the symptoms, a minor symptom, Johnson said in a new video message.

""I still have a temperature and so, in accordance with government advice, I must continue my self-isolation until that symptom itself goes,"" he said.

Johnson was last seen, still looking quite poorly, when he made a brief appearance at Downing Street on Thursday night to join the national clap for carers applause in appreciation of the hardwork of National Health Service (NHS) workers on the frontline of the fight against the outbreak.

""Remember that incredible clapping again last night for our fantastic NHS. We're doing it to protect them and to save lives. Let's focus on doing everything we can. Stay at home folks, protect our NHS, save lives,"" he said."

""We could start again in mid-May, in June or even late June,"" Aleksander Ceferin told Italy's La Repubblica daily.

Any time after that and ""the season will probably be lost,"" he said.

The idea of the entire season simply being cancelled stirs panic in fans of clubs such as Liverpool -- on the cusp of lifting their first title in 30 years.

Ceferin did not say when UEFA will issue a final ruling and stressed that consultations with the main leagues and clubs were still underway.

""There is also a proposal to end this season at the beginning of the next one and then start the next one a little later,"" said Ceferin.

The Slovenian added that he personally opposed the idea of holding big matches behind closed doors.

Belarus remain the only European nation still playing football in the face of a pandemic that has officially claimed around 28,000 lives worldwide.

Its world-leading toll from the novel coronavirus officially stands at 9,134."

“The church intends on continuing to safely gather for worship during Christianity’s most holy week, exercising unalienable and fundamental rights protected by the First Amendment’s right to peaceably assemble, freedom of speech, and the free exercise of religion, while simultaneously observing CDC recommended COVID-19 social distancing guidelines.  The U.S. Constitution is not suspended by a virus.”

466	News	1019019	Benedict Brook	We may never get a vaccine for COVID-19, an infectious diseases expert has warned	"Governments around the world have pinned their hopes of a vaccine for COVID-19 as being the end game in putting the virus to bed. 
But an infectious diseases expert has said it’s very possible a vaccine will never be found.
Talking to Karl Stefanovic and Allison Langdon on Channel 9’s Today show this morning, the University of Sydney’s David Isaacs said a vaccine wasn’t found for SARS or MERS – two previous coronavirus outbreaks.
“I think we are all hoping for a vaccine,” he said.
“People will certainly be developing vaccines, but they have to be tried out as well and see if they work. They have to be effective and that's not an easy task.
“We haven’t had a vaccine, an effective one, against a coronavirus before. The SARS outbreak in 2003, people were developing a vaccine, but it never got tried because SARS disappeared.
“I'm not going to say that is going to happen quite the same with COVID, but we may see COVID under control before we can really test out a vaccine,” he said.

RELATED: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson taken to hospital
Asked if that meant we would be in lockdown until a vaccine was found, Dr Issacs said that we might face restrictions until COVID-19 was “under control” possibly in some other form including that the virus simply burned itself out.
“Waiting for a vaccine is a hope but not a certainty. If we don't get a vaccine, we have got other alternatives.
“We found drugs for HIV; we never found a vaccine. We have controlled HIV pretty well in the world using antiviral drugs.
“At the moment we haven't got antiviral drugs (for COVID-19), they are being tested and we may get those, but in the meanwhile it’s public health measures that are the major weapon in our armoury.”
Hand washing, social distancing and supporting one another were effective methods of getting a handle on coronavirus and he added that “we are doing very well in Australia” because of those measures.
However, Dr Isaacs warned that a vaccine may itself cause unhelpful side effects due to the way some people’s immune systems reacted to the virus.
He cited UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s hospitalisation today (Australia time) after contracting coronavirus and yet still suffering from symptoms more than a week later.
“That may be because his immune response has kicked in and it is actually doing him some harm. His immune response to the vaccine is part of the problem almost, and that's why some younger people are getting sick.”
This is called a cytosine release where the immune system, particularly in healthy people, can go into overdrive and begin damaging the body rather than helping it recover.
“So, when you are developing a vaccine you might conceivably actually cause problems to some people. It is something that we will have to test very carefully.”
It was for that reason, Dr Issacs said, that young people needed to be wary of coronavirus. Because while most will recover, some could react extremely badly to the virus entering their system."
27	Reuters	1141214	Alexandra Alper	Trump voices hope for 'leveling-off' of coronavirus in hot spots	"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump expressed hope on Sunday that the United States was seeing a “leveling-off” of the coronavirus crisis in some of the nation’s hot spots, saying Americans were starting to see “the light at the end of the tunnel.” 
U.S. President Donald Trump speaks about the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak during the daily coronavirus task force briefing at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 5, 2020. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts


New York, the hardest-hit state, reported on Sunday that for the first time in a week, deaths had fallen slightly from the day before, but there were still nearly 600 new fatalities and more than 7,300 new cases.  
“Maybe that’s a good sign,” Trump told reporters at a White House briefing, referring to the drop in fatalities in New York. 
The United States faces a critical week in the coronavirus crisis, with the U.S. surgeon general warning on Sunday: This is going to be the hardest and the saddest week of most Americans’ lives, quite frankly.”. 
But  a few governors still resisted issuing stay-at-home orders and a handful of churches held large Palm Sunday services.  
Most states have ordered residents to stay home except for essential trips to slow the spread of the virus in the United States where over 335,000 people have tested positive and over 9,500 have died, according to a Reuters tally. 
White House medical experts have forecast that between 100,000 to 240,000 Americans could die in the pandemic, even if sweeping orders to stay home are followed. 
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Sunday that new hospitalizations had fallen by 50% over the previous 24 hours, but he cautioned it was not yet clear whether the crisis was reaching a plateau in the state, which has 4,159 deaths and more than 122,000 cases.  
“We’re starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” Trump said. But he added: “You can never be happy when so many people are dying.” 
Trump also said the United States was “very far down the line” on developing vaccines for the coronavirus. “We’ll see what happens,” he said.

1478	Stuff	983530	Melanie Earley	Coronavirus: 'Virtual check-in' trialled at two Auckland supermarkets to help ease queues	"A ""virtual check-in"" system is being trialled at two Auckland supermarkets in a bid to help keep customers safe during the level four lockdown.

Foodstuffs has introduced the technology – which allows customers to wait in their cars until it's their turn to enter the store – at New World in Kumeu and Pak 'n Save in Royal Oak.

""Our goal with the virtual 'check-in' solution is to improve the customer experience when New Zealanders arrive to our stores to do their essential shopping,"" Simon Kennedy, Chief Digital Officer of Foodstuffs North Island said.

""The physical distancing measures we need to maintain inspired the teams to innovate a solution which would simplify store arrival and give customers the flexibility to wait where they please.""

READ MORE:

 * Coronavirus: Full coverage

 * Staff member at Kaikohe New World tests positive for virus

 * Man arrested after coughing on fellow shoppers

During the trial customers at the two supermarkets can check in either virtually or physically at entry.

Those who check in virtually with their phones will be sent a text when it's their turn to enter, while those who check in physically will have their names added to a list which will be called out when it is their turn.

""The solution is easy, free and all customers need is a mobile phone,"" Kennedy said.

The virtual check-in means customers will not have to queue outside the store and instead can wait somewhere more comfortable such as their car until it is their turn.

""It's great for all customers, but particularly for those who are vulnerable or elderly who can now wait somewhere more comfortable. By reserving a virtual spot in line, they can now wait in their car or go for a walk around the block to get some fresh air,"" Kennedy said.

Store staff and signage will advise customers which number they should text and to answer any questions they might have.

The average virtual wait varies by how busy the store is and how many customers are allowed in the store based on the 2m physical distancing measure.

Further national roll out of the trial beyond New World Kumeu and Pak 'n Save Royal Oak will be decided at a later date."

It's fast emerging as one of the toughest challenges of the coronavirus crisis: how to persuade elderly parents and grandparents to stay home and out of infectious harm's way.

This generation is tremendously hardy, often infuriatingly independent and just don't like being told what to do by their youngers.

After all, they fought in wars, they remind us. They survived bombings, sometimes in their earlier homelands. They've known bleak economic conditions and shortages before.

And, they say feistily, they're a lot closer than most to the end of their lives, so what the hell?

I called my own parents, aged 82 and 89, this morning. They were out.

""People have to sit their parents and grandparents down and explain to them in very, very clear and simple terms why it's so important they stay at home,"" said Cheryl Field, the editor of The Senior newspaper.

""The main thing is to stress how urgent it is, but not to scare the living daylights out of them so they spend their time in the house shivering with fear.

""Then we're finding them falling into two camps, like any age group. There are some who'll obey and others who'll say, 'I'm 80 and I'm going to go out and do what the hell I want'. There's a lot of information going out online, but a lot of this group aren't online.""

A just published Harris Poll in the US found that the population most at risk – the elderly with 80-year-olds and over having a 15 per cent fatality rate compared to the average rate of 2.3 per cent – are the least worried about catching the disease and dying, and are the least informed.

Aged Care Minister Richard Colbeck said we should all remind them of the importance of social distancing, too.

""Unfortunately, the highest rate of fatalities is among older people, particularly those with a weakened immune system,"" he said.

Many elderly people are doing the right thing, believes comedian Jean Kittson, who's just brought out a new book We Need To Talk About Mum & Dad. But there are others who, for various reasons, aren't doing the right thing.

It's then important to talk to them about why they're insisting on going out. ""It might be that they think they're being less of a burden by doing their own shopping, rather than sending someone else out into the virus zone,"" she said. ""They might be doing out of some misplaced sense of self-sacrifice.

""But then you talk to them about how they would be much more useful to the family if they don't get sick or don't spread it to others. Sometimes they're not so concerned about getting it themselves because they're elderly and they feel they've lived their lives, but they don't want to give it to others.""

It's not just the stick of scary warnings that should work with older parents and grandparents, however. There are also carrots to offer them to stay at home.

Younger members of the family could do their shopping for them, set them up for online deliveries and suggest they install Zoom or Skype or use Facebook's Messenger for fun contact.

If they're not tech-savvy, their family could use the remote connectivity platform TeamViewer to install apps for them. Playing Scrabble online against an unknown opponent can be a refreshing diversion.

We can also talk them into streaming services, particularly to watch some of the old shows they might be most fond of, or pay for it ourselves. And there are long-lost hobbies to take up again, photos to organise on their computers, or older ones to sort through and finally stick into albums.

""Social isolation may be very difficult for them,"" said Kittson. ""So it's important to help them through it. You might ring them twice a day and stay in touch, and reassure them as they may have already experienced a lot of loss, especially if they've lost a partner.

""That might sometimes work better than reading them the riot act.""

US crude, meanwhile, fell as much as 8.5% on Sunday to trade around $26 a barrel, and Brent crude — the global benchmark — also fell more than 6%.

The drop in oil comes after OPEC and Russia on Saturday postponed a meeting to discuss supply cuts and an end to the price war. The meeting had been set for Monday, but is now scheduled for Thursday, an OPEC source told CNN.

Saudi Arabia and Russia have been locked in an epic price war since early March when the OPEC+ oil alliance cracked, flooding the oil market with cheap crude, just as demand cratered because of the coronavirus pandemic . Crude has crashed to 18-year lows, crushing American oil companies and energy stocks. The broader US stock market ended last week lower after a worse-than-expected jobs report for March. The US economy lost 701,000 jobs during the month — the worst report since 2009 and the first time in a decade the economy lost more jobs than it gained."

Jay Inslee decried the surgeon general's comments on Sunday comparing the anticipated swell in the coronavirus crisis to Pearl Harbor in light of the President's prior comments on qualifying federal support to states struggling to fight the outbreak .

""Can you imagine if Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, 'I'll be right behind you, Connecticut, good luck building those battleships'?"" Inslee told NBC on Sunday. ""Look, we need a national mobilization of the manufacturing base of the United States as we'd started on December 8, 1941.""

Earlier on Sunday, Surgeon General Jerome Adams predicted that this week would be the ""hardest and the saddest"" for ""most Americans' lives,"" describing the upcoming period of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States as ""our Pearl Harbor moment.""

Inslee, a Democrat, called it ""ludicrous that we don't have a national effort in this, to say 'we're a back up,'"" appearing to reference President Donald Trump's repeated comments that the federal stockpile should serve as ""a backup"" to states' reserves.

Inslee's comments come as governors , struggling to outfit frontline workers with personal protective equipment and ventilators as the number of coronavirus cases and deaths continues to climb, have experienced varying success in securing federal aid

The Washington state governor, who ran for the Democratic nomination for president last year, called for invoking the Defense Production Act, which gives the government more control during emergencies to direct industrial production, ""so that we can get these companies, instead of making cupholders, start making visors, start making test kits"" -- a scarce resource in many states, he added.

Inslee said that he and governors of both stripes ""have been urging the President to do what he should.""

""If he wants to be a wartime President, be a wartime President,"" Inslee added. ""Show some leadership, mobilize the industrial base in the United States -- that's what we need."""

Wilson was filmed singing ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" by her 24-year-old son Truman Hanks from their Los Angeles home, according to announcers Mike Joy and Jeff Gordon who led Sunday's broadcast of NASCAR's third virtual race.

Ever since the coronavirus suspended NASCAR's races last month, drivers have been competing against each other virtually using race simulators, which are similar to what you'd see in an arcade racing game. The races have been broadcast on Fox Sports, bringing in more than 1 million viewers, according to Nielsen.

The fact that Wilson was the one to sing the national anthem appeared to offer some hope to NASCAR fans during these difficult times.

""Beautifully done! Thanks for a small glimmer of hope, seeing and hearing you feeling better, Ms. Wilson,"" one fan commented. ""Excellent job. When we do get back to real racing, she should be invited to sing again,"" another commented. Wilson and her husband, actor Tom Hanks, announced that they were diagnosed with coronavirus on March 11 while they were in Australia. They have since returned to the US and are carrying on ""sheltering in place and social distancing,"" according to Hanks' tweet last Saturday. Wilson reflected on several life milestones in an Instagram post last Sunday. She talked about being a survivor of breast cancer, and now, a ""COVID 19 survivor."" ""Please take a moment today to acknowledge the amazing creation your bodies are and to thank it for doing so much,"" Wilson said in her post."

Hedge fund firms constantly search out bright intellectuals and highly-experienced employees and throw away millions of dollars on satellite photos and other research activities, so it is no wonder why they tend to generate millions in profits each year. It is also true that some hedge fund players fail inconceivably on some occasions, but net net their stock picks have been generating superior risk-adjusted returns on average over the years.
Is NuVasive, Inc. (NASDAQ:NUVA) an excellent investment right now? The best stock pickers are getting more bullish. The number of long hedge fund bets increased by 3 recently. Our calculations also showed that NUVA isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q4 rankings and see the video at the end of this article for Q3 rankings).
At the moment there are a large number of indicators shareholders employ to analyze their holdings. A duo of the most under-the-radar indicators are hedge fund and insider trading signals. We have shown that, historically, those who follow the top picks of the top fund managers can outpace the broader indices by a healthy amount (see the details here).

We leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example, we believe electric vehicles and energy storage are set to become giant markets, and we want to take advantage of the declining lithium prices amid the COVID-19 pandemic. So we are checking out investment opportunities like this one. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. Our best call in 2020 was shorting the market when SP 500 was trading at 3150 after realizing the coronavirus pandemic's significance before most investors. Keeping this in mind we're going to go over the new hedge fund action surrounding NuVasive, Inc. (NASDAQ:NUVA).

(NASDAQ:NUVA) is not the least popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still below average. This is a slightly negative signal and we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. Our calculations showed that top 20 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 41.3% in 2019 and outperformed the SP 500 ETF (SPY) by 10.1 percentage points. These stocks lost 17.4% in 2020 through March 25th but beat the market by 5.5 percentage points. Unfortunately NUVA wasn't nearly as popular as these 20 stocks (hedge fund sentiment was quite bearish); NUVA investors were disappointed as the stock returned -34.2% during the same time period and underperformed the market.

1551	The Sun - UK	1106745	Amanda Devlin	Dynamo reveals life-threatening Crohn's disease battle after getting COVID-19	"HE has performed to 750,000 people during a live tour, sold out London’s O2 arena, counts Brad Pitt and Justin Bieber among his fans and has wowed TV audiences with his brand of intimate close-up magic and mesmerising big-budget stunts.

But all that came crashing down around Dynamo’s ears in the summer of 2017 when he suffered such a serious flare up of his Crohn’s disease that he feared for both his life and his livelihood.

After a two-year battle to regain his health, Dynamo – real name Steven Frayne – makes a triumphant return to our screens this week in Beyond Belief, his first all-magic TV show since Magician Impossible ended in 2014.

Having suffered from Crohn’s since his teenage years – he had half of his stomach removed at the age of 17 – the 37 year old is used to managing pain and discomfort, but as he sits down for an interview with TV Mag during our exclusive photo shoot, Dynamo reveals that he’s never felt worse than when he got a bout of food poisoning three years ago.

“The easiest way to sum up Crohn’s is to imagine an open wound on your hand, but inside your tummy, and every time you eat it’s like rubbing dirt into that wound,” he explains.

“Obviously some food is dirtier than others and it can cause your tummy to bleed, so it’s a wound that never quite heals up.

""I don’t want to sound too disgusting, but with this food poisoning, there was a lot of stuff coming out everywhere. You know like in Family Guy when they vomit? It was like that, but blood.

""It was 4am and my wife rushed me to hospital. I could tell it was something to do with the Crohn’s, but when I got to hospital the highest dosage of morphine wasn’t even touching the sides. It was the worst feeling I’ve ever had.”

He ended up facing a five-week stretch in hospital, much of it in isolation because doctors were unsure whether he was contagious or at risk from other people.

“I’m very comfortable in my own company because I was always left alone when I was on my estate in Bradford growing up – my dad was in jail and my mum wasn’t always around,” shares Dynamo.

“My imagination became my best friend then. So when I was in isolation in the hospital, after getting over the burden of thinking: ‘Am I ever going to perform again?’ I started to create loads of crazy magic. I’m not going to lie, I was definitely high on the medication the doctors were giving me!”

That stay in hospital wasn’t the end of Dynamo’s suffering, however. After he was discharged, he developed reactive arthritis, and was put on an extremely high dose of steroids to treat his swollen and painful joints. That resulted in his whole body puffing up, creating what he describes as a “moonface”, and pictures surfaced that shocked his fans.

“My appearance was changing and it was getting harder to hide that I wasn’t the same old Steven that people knew,” he says. “I didn’t want to be defined by my illness and I didn’t want to burden people with my problems.

""But when some images came out I decided to make a video on Instagram explaining to people the real story behind them. The outpouring of support I got spurred me on.

""But it was also quite funny because I never thought I would see in my Instagram comments people calling me fat – I thought it was hilarious because I have always been the skinny kid. I was sending the pig emoji to all of my friends!”

The 37-year-old magician revealed he has been battling ""severe"" coronavirus symptoms.

He is considered a high risk for the deadly illness because of Crohn's disease.

While Dynamo admits that he’s still only at 85 per cent fitness and is in hospital every other week for powerful infusions of medicine that helps keep his arthritis and Crohn’s at bay, he’s determined to turn what he describes as his darkest days into something positive.

“It’s very easy to wallow in the sickness, especially when you feel like you’re losing everything that’s important around you,” he reflects. “Not being able to perform magic, for me, I didn’t see the point in being alive. It’s my identity. But it caused me to find myself in a different way. And I’ve definitely taken my disabilities and turned them into superpowers.

“Beyond Belief has definitely been the hardest I’ve ever had to work to create something, but it’s come from such a personal place. I genuinely think this is the best magic I have ever done. I want to show people I’m back. This is only the beginning of the return of Dynamo…”"

Korean Student to Face Punishment for Hiding Symptoms at Quarantine Check	"A teenage South Korean student that arrived from the United States is likely to face stern punishment for passing airport quarantine checks after taking medicine for a fever to hide symptoms of the coronavirus.


Kwon Jun-wook, deputy director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(KCDC), vowed strict consequences for the act during a press briefing on Sunday.


Kwon said that in accordance with relevant laws, the government will take steps to ensure stern punishment for the student's ""illegal and wrongful"" act that could have caused massive damage to public health. 


He stressed that people who provide a false report to quarantine officials can be jailed for up to one year and fined up to ten million won.


Late last month, the student reportedly took medicine for fever in high doses before departing from the U.S. and again after arriving in South Korea to pass quarantine checks although he or she had symptoms before departure. The student then tested positive for COVID-19 on March 26 in Busan."
1925	Fortune	967756	Jenna Schnuer	Coronavirus gave cannabis companies a big bump in sales and it wasn't just for the wake-and-bake set	"As a wide range of American economy sectors ground to a halt in response to the coronavirus crisis, one particular industry headed in the other direction. Across the United States during the week of March 16, cannabis dispensaries saw their sales soar by double digits. One company dealt with hour-long lines at its Pennsylvania stores. On March 16th alone, sales doubled in California. 



Roy Bingham, CEO of cannabis market research firm BDS Analytics, said he expects the industry to not only ride out the coming economic storm but continue to grow. His firm has yet to revise its prediction of a 30% jump to $17 billion in U.S. retail sales for 2020. “First, you have this existing core demand; 65% of cannabis consumers consume on a daily basis,” said Bingham. “And now you have people who can’t go to the gym or the bar and are locked up at home, where about half of all cannabis consumptions happens anyway.”



Though sales flattened out after that initial bump in sales, the demand for cannabis isn’t expected to dip anytime soon. Thus far, none of the 22 states with legal marijuana dispensaries have ordered them closed (although Nevada moved to delivery only and some companies have decided their customers must order online before coming to the store). Most U.S. dispensaries remain open, often classified as essential services, though, in Canada, Ontario took pot shops off the essential list and ordered them closed by April 3.



The fact that marijuana could remain one of the fastest growing sectors of the economy has much to do with the fact the product is hardly just for stoners anymore. In recent years, cannabis companies have been busy opening new dispensaries in mainstream, high traffic locations. Sleek, spacious, and uncluttered, they often look more like Apple stores or places to buy upscale furniture than traditional headshops that appealed more to counterculture types. The goal is, at many of the newer shops, to educate consumers and entice people to think of marijuana as no different than a glass of wine or a few beers. 



“The stoner stereotype is not dead, but it’s not the primary cannabis consumer these days,” said Jessica Lukas, vice president of consumer insights at BDS Analytics. 



Cannabis 2.0 consumers are older and more female than cannabis enthusiasts of years past,  and they’re showing up at dispensaries not just to get high but for health and wellness needs. “A good night’s sleep and pain relief are the biggest drivers for people coming into our stores,” said Jennifer Dooley, chief strategy officer at Green Thumb Industries, which operates Rise dispensaries in seven states. 



Even High Times, the longtime chronicler of the stoner lifestyle and a “magazine of high society” tagline, is going mainstream. Stormy Simon, High Times CEO, said the company will open two “clean and inviting” dispensaries in Las Vegas and Los Angeles later this year. They will feature legacy High Times memorabilia but also welcome people who have little-to-nothing in common with old-school stoners “with open arms.” 



Much like other dispensary companies, High Times will bring in new consumers with the help of new kinds of cannabis products. While straight marijuana, or flower, remains a core product, the fastest growing categories are edibles and other smokeless options—from gummies and chocolates to tinctures, breath sprays, and bath salts. Instead of touting THC levels or “terpene profiles,” these products are packaged to appeal to specific consumer segments or address a particular need. Green Thumb’s Feel Collection tinctures, for instance, loos like something you might buy in a beauty store. Packaged in elegant purple, blue, and green glass bottles, the products target middle-aged women (“blends cannabis extracts with natural ingredients to make every day a little more heck yeah”). Each product promises a desired effect, including comfort, dreamy, energized, relaxed, or healed.



There is even cannabis in capsule form that’s packaged in the well-known look of a prescription drug bottle. “We’re not going to ask grandma to roll a joint, so we focus on forms that are familiar and comfortable to people,” says Greg Butler, chief commercial officer at Cresco, which sells Remedi cannabis capsules. Brands also focus on appealing to people who worry their weed will leave them unable to get off the couch and function normally (aka “couch lock”), though that may be less of an issue during the coronavirus lockdown. “Our Beebo brand has much more subtle, lower THC levels. We call it a social dose. You can enjoy it but still go on with your day,” said Green Thumb’s Dooley.



But perhaps no consumer is as attractive to cannabis companies as seniors. Not only are they more likely to have medical conditions that cannabis could address, they’re also the most free-spending of all users. According to Eaze, a cannabis software platform and marketplace, baby boomers spend, on average, close to 30% more at dispensaries than millennials. Yet reaching these consumers, along with other segments of the population, is a challenge because marijuana’s continued illegal status at the federal level renders TV and digital ads off limits. As a result, many companies are taking their pitch directly into senior communities. 



Earlier this month, Trulieve, which operates 45 dispensaries in Florida, hosted a “Silver Tour” at a large retirement community in Tamarac, Fla. Featuring free Panera Bread and a doctor who spoke about marijuana and medical conditions, it drew several hundred attentive audience members. “When I started doing this, they said, ‘We don’t want these shows; our people are not interested in marijuana,’” said Robert Platshorn, a marijuana activist who runs and organizes these events for Trulieve. “Now it’s a matter of getting to all the senior communities who would like to have us.”

Trump told a White House briefing that over the last 24 hours the federal government has delivered an additional 500 ventilators to New Jersey, which is among the hardest-hit states. He said they have also sent 200 ventilators to Louisiana and 300 to Michigan. Another 600 have gone to Illinois, he said, while Massachusetts will be getting 100.

The ventilator disbursements come as governors have clamored for weeks for the Trump administration to do more to confront the shortage of the crucially needed machines, which allow seriously ill coronavirus patients to breathe.

New York and Louisiana have both warned in particular that they do not have enough ventilators for the coming onslaught.

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) said earlier Sunday on CNN that his state had received 200 ventilators from the federal government but still expected to run out on April 9.

The ventilator announcement comes as federal officials are warning that the coming week will be particularly bad, as the peak of cases nears, especially in hot spots like New York.

“This is going to be the hardest and the saddest week of most Americans’ lives,” Surgeon General Jerome Adams said on Fox News Sunday.

Trump, who has bashed several governors repeatedly, instead offered some positive words on Sunday.

Still, when mentioning the ventilators going to Illinois, Trump noted, “there's a governor, I hear him complaining all the time, Pritzker.”

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) kept up his criticism of the Trump administration earlier Sunday for not fully using the Defense Production Act to direct businesses to ramp up production of needed supplies and coordinate where they will go. States have said they are now in a bidding war with each other because of a lack of federal leadership.

“The president does not understand the word federal,” Pritzker said on CNN on Sunday, adding: “individual states can't possibly do what the federal government can do.”"
323	BBC UK	2432059	Claire Press	Why some NHS workers are wearing bin bags	"As the death toll from coronavirus continues to climb, hospitals across the UK are working flat out to create more intensive care beds for those who are critically ill. Speaking to the BBC, one intensive care doctor describes the crippling reality of a lack of support and equipment faced by some health-care workers in England. 
Several healthcare workers in England have told the BBC of a lack of equipment in their hospitals. Warned against speaking to the media, they were unwilling to talk publicly. However, one intensive care doctor from the Midlands wanted to go on record. The BBC agreed to change her name in order to protect her identity. 
Dr Roberts describes a hospital on the brink. Intensive care is already full of coronavirus (Covid-19) patients. All operations deemed non-urgent, even the cancer clinics, have been cancelled. There is a lack of staff, a lack of critical care beds, a shortage of basic antibiotics and ventilators. 
All this, combined with the looming uncertainty of what will be the expected peak, estimated to hit the UK around 14-15 April, means hospital staff are already feeling the strain.
However, nothing Dr Roberts describes is quite as alarming as the fact that these medical professionals, who continue to care for critically ill patients for 13 hours every day, are having to resort to fashioning personal protective equipment (PPE) out of clinical waste bags, plastic aprons and borrowed skiing goggles.

            
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
            
                Image caption
                
                    Dr Roberts shown in the left picture, tying a bin bag covering the sides and back of her colleague's head
                
            
            
        While the public attempts to keep to a social distance of two metres, many NHS staff are being asked to examine patients suspected of coronavirus at a distance of 20cm - without the proper protection. 
With potentially fatal implications, Dr Roberts says several departments within her hospital are now so fearful of what's coming next, they have begun to hoard PPE for themselves.
""It's about being pragmatic. The nurses on ITU (Intensive Treatment Unit) need it now. They are doing procedures which risk aerosol spread of the virus. But they've been told to wear normal theatre hats, which have holes in them and don't provide any protection. 
""It's wrong. And that's why we're having to put bin bags and aprons on our heads.""

            
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
        The government has acknowledged distribution problems, but says a national supply team, supported by the armed forces, is now ""working around the clock"" to deliver equipment. 
NHS England also said more than one million respiratory face masks were delivered on 1 April, but with no mention of much-needed head protection and long-sleeved gowns. 
Dr Roberts says her hospital has not received anything from the government, and what they do have is causing concern. 
""The respiratory protection face masks we're using at the moment, they've all been relabelled with new best-before end dates. Yesterday I found one with three stickers on. The first said, expiry 2009. The second sticker, expiry 2013. And the third sticker on the very top said 2021."" 
Public Health England has said all stockpiled pieces of PPE [personal protective equipment] labelled with new expiry dates have ""passed stringent tests"" and are ""safe for use by NHS staff"". But Dr Roberts says she is not convinced.

            
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
            
                Image caption
                
                    Dr Roberts pulls expiry date stickers from the packaging on a face mask
                
            
            
        The Department of Health and Social Care also said it was ""working closely with industry, the NHS, social care providers and the Army… If staff need to order more PPE there is a hotline in place"".
It said its new guidance on PPE was in line with World Health Organization advice to ""make sure all clinicians are aware of what they should be wearing"". 
Currently ventilated and under Dr Roberts' care are three of her colleagues, all of whom have tested positive for coronavirus. One is an intensive care doctor working on a Covid ward, who, like Dr Roberts, only had access to inadequate protection.
The other two were both working on non-Covid wards and therefore were wearing no PPE. However, given their symptoms, Dr Roberts believes both of them contracted the virus while at work. 
Although colleagues continue to visit, as with all other patients, no relatives are allowed anywhere within the hospital. 
""The hardest thing at the moment is having to tell families you are withdrawing care, over the phone. Telling them their relatives are dying or have died but we can't let you come and see them,"" says Dr Roberts.

            
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
        ""Normally you can say to their relative who's at the bedside, 'We're going to do everything we can', but I haven't felt able to say that, because at the moment, I can't. 
""I can't necessarily give them the best care on a ventilator, I can't guarantee the best nursing care, because the best nurses are being stretched four ways. We're running out of antibiotics, and I can't guarantee all the treatments that I know would help them.""
NHS England says it has no record of how many medical professionals have been admitted to hospital after contracting coronavirus at work. 
However, the two hardest-hit countries in Europe are counting. Spain's emergency health minister announced on 27 March that more than 9,400 health-care workers had tested positive, and in Italy, as of 30 March, more than 6,414 medical professionals were reported to have been infected.
In the UK, several health workers are known to have died from coronavirus, including Areema Nasreen, a staff nurse in the West Midlands, Thomas Harvey, a health-care assistant in east London, Prof Mohamed Sami Shousha in central London, Dr Alfa Saadu in north London, Dr Habib Zaidi in Southend, Dr Adil El Tayar in west London and Dr Amged El-Hawrani in Leicester.
Breaking point
Based on projections from Italy and Spain, Dr Roberts says health-care workers are bracing for the peak to hit in less than two weeks. 
""If cases rise as quickly as they did in Spain and Italy, then quite frankly, we are screwed. All of our overspill areas will soon be full. 
""The anaesthetic machines we have, which are designed to work for two to three hours at most, have been running for four to five days straight. We're already getting leaks and failures.""

        Extra intensive care beds, set up in several operating theatres and wards, have nearly doubled the hospital's capacity to support critically ill patients, particularly those who can't breathe for themselves and need to be put on a ventilator. 
However, by expanding intensive care, Dr Roberts says it's the nursing staff who are disproportionately affected. 
""Intensive care nurses are highly trained and normally deliver care one-to-one to those critically ill. Their patients may be asleep, but they have such a close relationship, they can describe every hair on a patient's head. 
""But now, with these extra beds, nurses are under pressure to look after up to four patients, while delivering the same level of critical care. They are in tears and really struggling. They are the most important part of the system, but that's where it's going to fall down"". 
Stay at home 
Outside in the hospital car park, Dr Roberts describes how a new temporary building has appeared in the ambulance bay with just one purpose - to vet all patients for symptoms of coronavirus before they are admitted. 
It is run by a clinician, who, Dr Roberts points out, could otherwise be looking after patients. She describes the unit as a ""lie detector"".

        ""It's really common for people to lie about their symptoms just to get seen. People who should have stayed at home, but they come to AE. 
""So now every single patient gets vetted in the car park, to make sure those with Covid symptoms go to the right part of the hospital and don't infect everyone else, like those who've come in with a broken arm.""
But for Dr Roberts, it's not just about those turning up at AE, it's everyone.

Vietnam has not recorded any new coronavirus infections Monday morning and in the past 24 hours, only one more case has been added.



The national tally, as such, is kept at 241 since the evening of Sunday, according to the Ministry of Health.
Monday morning marks the second morning in a row that the nation has had no new cases of Covid-19, after several were reported every morning for almost a month.
On Sunday evening, a 20-year-old Vietnamese student returning from the U.K. took the country’s total count to 241.
Of the 241 Covid-19 patients in Vietnam, 91 have been discharged.
Many of the 150 active cases are Vietnamese nationals returning from abroad, mostly from Europe and the U.S., and more than 60 people are related to the two major Covid-19 hotspots in the country – the Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi with at least 43 cases and Buddha Bar  Grill in Ho Chi Minh City 18 cases.
The country entered a 15-day nationwide social distancing campaign on April 1, not allowing gatherings of more than two people and asking people not to leave their homes to contain the spread of the pandemic. The step was taken citing a crucial two-week period in the nation’s Covid-19 fight.
The government also suspended all inbound international flights and halted road transport services until April 15 to limit travel in the country of 94 million people. 
The global death toll caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has reached more than 69,300 people as it spread to 208 countries and territories."
19	CNET	1017702	Steven Musil	Apple designing and producing face shields for coronavirus medical workers	"Apple announced Sunday it's launched a companywide effort to design, produce and ship face shields to medical workers battling the coronavirus outbreak. The first shipment was delivered this week to a Kaiser facility in the Santa Clara Valley, Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a video posted to Twitter.

""Teams across Apple have been working hard on ways we can support our heroic front-line medical professionals,"" Cook said, explaining that the fully adjustable shields pack flat and can be assembled in two minutes. ""The feedback from doctors was very positive.""

""We plan to ship over 1 million by the end of this week, and over 1 million per week after that,"" he said.

Cook said the company is coordinating with health and government officials across the US to get the shields delivered where they're needed and hopes to expand distribution beyond the US quickly.

Cook also said that the number of face masks it's procured from its supply chain has risen to more than 20 million.

""This is truly a global effort, and we're working continuously and closely with governments at all levels to ensure these are donated to places of greatest need,"" he said. ""For Apple this is a labor of love and gratitude.""

The new coronavirus causes the respiratory disease COVID-19. In March, the World Health Organization declared the virus outbreak a pandemic. As of Thursday, 1 million people worldwide have been infected and over 51,000 lives have been lost. The outbreak has caused cities and entire countries around the globe to issue lockdowns, shuttering stores, canceling events and ordering citizens to stay at home to help contain the coronavirus.

Apple's push to produce and distribute face shield is just the latest effort by the company to help during the pandemic. The company has donated millions of dollars to help combat the coronavirus.

Apple has also partnered with actor Leonardo DiCaprio and Laurene Powell Jobs to launch a new organization to raise money ""to feed the country's most vulnerable populations"" impacted by the novel coronavirus.  The trio started America's Food Fund with $12 million as part of an effort to collect money for groups that help feed children who rely on school lunch programs, low-income families, the elderly, individuals facing job disruptions and other people impacted by the pandemic.

27	Reuters	1149086	Reuters Editorial	UPDATE 1-Rolls-Royce to ditch targets and suspend dividend due to coronavirus- FT	"(Adds details from FT report, company comment, background) 
April 5 (Reuters) - British aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce will abandon its targets on profits, cash and deliveries, and suspend its dividend, as airlines around the world ground planes due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Financial Times reported late on Sunday. 
Rolls-Royce is also aiming to announce new credit facilities in excess of 1 billion pounds ($1.22 billion) to bolster liquidity, the newspaper said on.ft.com/2ULsL7q. 
Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for large civil and military planes, has been hit hard by the pandemic as its airline customers park hundreds of planes. 
In March, engine flying hours were down by about 40%, the newspaper said, citing a source. The company is paid by airlines based on how many hours its engines fly. 
At the end of February, Rolls Royce had forecast 2020 free cash flow of 1 billion pounds, excluding any material impact from COVID-19. The group will ditch that pledge, the FT said. 
The dividend payment of 11.7 pence per share, which has been frozen since 2016, will also be suspended, the newspaper added. 
Rolls-Royce declined to comment. 
In addition, the FT said the company on Monday will reopen its civil aerospace facilities in the UK with a fraction of the normal workforce, after suspending operations in March. 
The company could also eventually furlough some 50% of its 7,500 UK shop-floor workers, with wages supported by government subsidy, two sources told the newspaper.

700	Times of India	418438		Four from Belagavi who attended Tablighi Jamaat test positive | Hubballi News - Times of India	Belagavi: Four people from Belagavi tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday.According to the state bulletin, a 36-year-old woman, 40-year-old man, 67-year-old woman and 41-year-old woman, who hail from Raibagh taluk of Belagavi district, tested positive for Covid-19.They had visited the Tablighi Jamaat congregation from March 13 to March 18. With this the total number of Covid-19 cases in the district stands at 7. The earlier three Covid-19 cases were also linked to the Tablighi Jamaat event.The district administration has quarantined all the patients. The district administration has also begun contact tracing to isolate primary and secondary contacts.Earlier in the day, a video clip claiming that two Covid-19 patients were loitering around corridors of the quarantine facility, showcasing that proper treatment was not given to the patients, surfaced on social media. This led many to question how the authorities were dealing with the crisis.However, the deputy commissioner disputed the claims in a video briefing. He said, “Some audio and video clips are going viral on social media. I would like to inform that these materials are misleading in nature. Some people from outside are circulating this video, and we have already filed a case in the relevant police station. Action will be taken against the people who are circulating the video.” He said that all the Covid-19 patients are being treated as per protocol, and that there is no scope for any discrepancies.
700	Times of India	418438		Hindalga prison steps forward to stitch masks for newspaper hawkers | Hubballi News - Times of India	Belagavi: That Covid-19 infection has sent the Indian economy into a tailspin is an acknowledged fact today. But help for many an ailing sector is coming from unexpected quarters, and one such instance is the Hindalga Central Prison offering to make and provide masks for newspaper hawkers to help the print media in a time of considerable distress.Misinformation about newspapers spreading the Covid-19 infection on various social media portals has resulted in many readers growing apprehensive about picking them up. Consequently, representatives of various newspapers convened a meeting with agents and vendors of Belagavi district, also attended by officials of the government, wherein it was resolved to provide masks, surgical gloves and hand sanitisers to all the hawkers to allay any niggling fears in the minds of the readers.Across Belagavi district, there are around 300 individuals employed by various vendors and agents to deliver newspapers, and the decision to equip them with the necessary safety gear will help convince the readers of the precautions being taken to keep newspapers safe.Belagavi deputy commissioner SB Bommanahalli asked the agents to place an order for masks from the Hindalga Central Prison. Inmates of the prison have been stitching masks for the past ten days, which are currently being used by the cops, he said. “The pharmacies do not have enough masks and the district administration cannot provide the safety equipment as a result. Under such circumstances, getting masks from Hindalga prison is a good alternative,” Bommanahalli said.Mahantesh Patil,a newspaper agent in Belagavi, said that providing masks and gloves will make their hawkers feel a lot safer. “We will approach authorities at Hindalga to buy masks. The authorities are offering them at a very nominal price of Rs 6 or Rs 7, which will make it easier for us to purchase and also ensure our operations remain viable,” Patil added.Chief superintendent of police (prisons) Krishna Kumar confirmed to TOI that Hindalga jail could provide sufficient number of masks for the hawkers. “This way, we will also join the battle against the misinformation campaign. U have asked our skilled inmates to start stitching more masks so we can meet the demand soon,” Kumar added.The senior police official said that manufacturing 300 masks was not in the least an onerous task for the inmates. “These masks are being stitched from cotton, and we will charge a minimal price. We have already distributed 30 masks stitched at the prison to journalists in Belagavi,” Kumar said.The inmates are being taught tailoring under the skill development programme at the prison to enable them to lead a life of dignity once they are freed.

4995	INQUIRER.net (Philippines)	1105401	Niña V. Guno	Bleach thrown at hospital worker in Sultan Kudarat	"MANILA, Philippines — A frontliner at a hospital in Tacurong City, Sultan Kudarat was attacked with bleach while on his way to work Friday.

The incident comes after the Department of Health’s (DOH) confirmation on Thursday that an 87-year-old man from Sultan Kudarat, who died March 14, was found to have been positive for COVID-19.

St. Louis Hospital said in a statement on Saturday that one of its staff was mobbed by a group of five who “splattered Zonrox all over his face, which could have caused irreparable and permanent damage to his sight.” The personnel managed to go to the hospital to receive treatment.

The hospital reported the incident to local police and called for justice. “Our personnel is a breadwinner, as many of our frontliners are, who in the present pandemonium, chose to bravely continue their duties to the community,” it said.

It also called for solidarity toward health professionals. “Instead of discriminating the healthcare workers, to the point of committing untold violence against them, we, as a community should show solidarity with these individuals who risk their lives so that continued medical service remains unhampered.”

St. Louis Hospital treated a patient under investigation (PUI) who died on March 14. It only received the patient’s coronavirus disease (COVID-19) results on March 25 and said in a statement on the same day that the results had been leaked online.

Without specifying an incident, the hospital said then that its frontliners had experienced “discriminatory actions.”

It assured that as of Saturday, none of its staff have been infected with the coronavirus.

4817	Google News Canada	2432051	Michael Holden And Kylie Maclellan	What’s Plan B if coronavirus incapacitates Boris Johnson? No clear answer yet	"Britain’s constitution offers no clear answer to the question now on many Britons’ minds: what happens if Prime Minister Boris Johnson, undergoing tests in hospital after persistent symptoms of coronavirus, cannot continue to lead.
Johnson was admitted to hospital on Sunday in what his office said was a “precautionary step” after testing positive 10 days ago and still suffering from a high temperature. He remains in charge of the government, his office said.
Johnson has said he can keep working from self-isolation in his Downing Street residence, just as his health secretary, Matt Hancock, who also tested positive for the virus, has done.
But the fact that two such crucial leaders in the UK’s fight against the pandemic have contracted the disease has raised questions about how the government would function without them at a time of global crisis.

	The constitution — an unwieldy collection of sometimes ancient and contradictory precedents — offers no clear, formal “Plan B” or succession scenario, experts said.
“We’ve not been in that kind of situation, we’ve not had to think about it from that point of view before,” Catherine Haddon, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government, told Reuters soon after Johnson was first diagnosed.
Whereas in the United States the vice president steps up if the president dies or becomes incapacitated, Britain has no formal deputy or caretaker prime minister who would take over.

		Nor is there any guidance for such circumstances in the Cabinet Manual which sets out the rules and conventions for the running of government, and there is little precedence.
When asked about who would stand in for the prime minister, his spokesman said: “The prime minister has the power to delegate responsibility to any of his ministers, but for now it is the prime minister and then the foreign secretary.”
	
	Churchill’s stroke
In June 1953, then-Prime Minister Winston Churchill suffered a stroke while in office. His illness was kept so secret that some senior ministers were unaware.

	Churchill surprised doctors by recovering to carry on his duties, returning to Downing Street and running the cabinet two months later.
More recently, Tony Blair twice underwent treatment for a heart condition while prime minister in the early 2000s, each time briefly cutting back on his workload for a couple of days.
Officials said that if Blair were to have been incapacitated, his then-deputy John Prescott would have taken over until a new leader was elected.

There is no suggestion Johnson is unable to perform his job. Since his diagnosis, he has carried on leading the government’s efforts through the use of teleconferencing.
Muddle through?
Bob Kerslake, head of the civil service from January 2012 to September 2014, said Johnson’s role was crucial at this time, stressing that visible leadership was essential.
Kerslake, speaking to Sky News last month after Johnson tested positive, said officials would need to know what would happen if senior ministers were unable to do their jobs.
Losing Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, who coordinates policy across government, would be a serious blow.
“He is critical to all of this,” Kerslake said. “If, for whatever reason, he was ill, who takes over from him?”

“If you got to a stage where … you had secretaries of state who aren’t able to perform their functions, then there are question marks about whether junior ministers in their department act on their behalf,” she said.
One lawmaker in Johnson’s party, who has repeatedly tried to bring in a law to formalize who would replace a prime minister in the event of incapacity, said last month that no one seemed to know what would happen.
“In a national emergency, you don’t want to be scrabbling around worrying about who’s in charge,” Peter Bone told the Mirror newspaper."
27	Reuters	1020460	Hyunjoo Jin	Solid chip sales unlikely to cushion Samsung's virus-hit first quarter profit	"SEOUL (Reuters) - The coronavirus-driven global shift to working from home is set to have boosted demand for Samsung Electronics’ memory chips from laptop makers and data centres, but first-quarter profits are likely to remain flat as the outbreak weakened consumer electronics sales. 
FILE PHOTO: 'Closed' notices are displayed at the entrance of Galaxy Harajuku, a flagship store of the Galaxy brand mobile computing devices by Samsung Electronics, during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Tokyo, Japan March 26, 2020.  REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo


The South Korean tech giant is the world’s largest memory chip maker, and its Galaxy smartphones are a major rival of Apple Inc’s products.  
Samsung, which also makes home appliances and displays, on Tuesday releases guidance for the January-March quarter profit which is widely expected to be unchanged, and come under pressure in the next few quarters as the impact of coronavirus-related factory and retail stores shutdowns bites. 
“The visibility for Samsung’s earnings is low for the second quarter,” said Lee Do-hoon, an analyst at CIMB Research. 
For the quarter which just ended, Samsung is likely to estimate its operating profit at 6.2 trillion won ($5.05 billion), unchanged from the same period a year ago, according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate, weighted towards more consistently accurate analysts. 
However, the company already warned last month that the pandemic would hurt sales of smartphones and consumer electronics goods this year, and analysts said a prolonged virus outbreak could put higher demand for memory chips at risk. 
“If COVID-19 continues into 2H20, the memory market outlook could change for the worse,” CW Chung, head of research at Nomura in Korea, said in a recent report. 
When the outbreak first started in China last year, Samsung’s strategy of spreading out its production base to countries including Vietnam and India seemed to pay off: rivals such as Apple were hit by supply disruptions as China shut down factories and locked down cities to control the coronavirus. 
Apple rescinded its profit forecast earlier this year due to production halts and retail store shutdowns in China. 
But as the virus spread across the globe, Samsung too has had to close factories and retail stores in Europe, India and the United States, further unnerving investors: Samsung Electronics shares have slumped 15% so far this year, but outperformed the wider market’s 22% fall. 
Prospects for Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S20 premium smartphones, launched more than one month ago, look dim. Its 5G-enabled S20 phones are already selling at a third of their launch price of $1,308 in South Korea, an official at a local carrier told Reuters. 
Brokerage Hanwha Investment  Securities estimates Samsung smartphone sales fell 17% in the first quarter from a year earlier. Last year, a slump in profits at the smartphone and chip businesses more than halved Samsung’s full-year earnings. 
Its display business, which counts Apple and China’s Huawei Technologies as customers, is likely to have swung back to a loss after three consecutive quarterly profit due to sluggish demand from its clients, analysts said. 
Samsung only provides its estimates for its first-quarter revenue and operating profit on Tuesday, with details likely to be released later this month.

1478	Stuff	957527	Tim Newman	Nelson City Council calls for alcohol licensing fee waiver	"An empty Trafalgar St seen here on day one of the coronavirus lockdown.

The Nelson City Council is appealing to the Government to enable them to waive alcohol licensing fees for businesses in the hospitality sector.

Alcohol licensing fees are set by the Ministry of Justice, which administrates the Alcohol Regulatory and Licensing Authority.

In a letter to the ministry, Nelson Mayor Rachel Reese requested that the licensing fees be waived for businesses while the country remains at levels three and four on the coronavirus lockdown.

Reese said she was not comfortable with council collecting fees that would deliver no community value while businesses were unable to operate.

 * New Zealand King Salmon splits shifts, practices social distancing as sales drop in lockdown

""As a council we want to do everything in our power to help the hospitality industry because it is so key to Nelson's economy, but our hands are tied by legislation.

""Fees like these can make the difference between surviving this period or shutting down.""

Reese said while the request might seem like a small gesture, every bit of assistance from the Government was needed to help support the hospitality sector.

In Nelson there are currently 169 licensed premises, with council aware of at least 50 licenses and certificates that are due for renewal this month.

Annual fees range from $140 to $1250 per licence depending on the risk rating of the business. Licence application fees (paid three-yearly for established compliant businesses and annually for new businesses) range from $320 to $1050.

Council's tourism and hospitality tenants have been offered a three-month rent holiday, while hospitality businesses will also be given a three month holiday from their Outdoor Dining Licenses.

Hospitality New Zealand chief executive Julie White said relief from extra costs like licensing fees could help keep businesses afloat and people in employment, and help spur on a recovery when isolation measures were lifted.

White said businesses were trying to keep staff on board, and still needed to cover costs for capital, rent, and utilities.

""Businesses are already digging into their reserves but there's only so much there. ""

She said she hoped other councils would follow Nelson's lead and look to implement similar policies if possible.

Businesses with Alcohol Licences throughout the country had already been significantly affected by the Covid-19 restrictions, she said.

""Many of these businesses cannot operate during levels three and four, and only operate at a severely reduced capacity during level 2.

1478	Stuff	941156	Stuff	Coronavirus: Trump upbeat as New York reports first drop in deaths	"""Maybe that's a good sign,"" Trump said of the decrease in New York deaths from the virus.

US President Donald Trump says he's hopeful the country is seeing a possible levelling off of coronavirus in hard-hit areas.

New York State reported 594 new coronavirus deaths on Sunday (Monday NZT), fewer than the 630 it reported on Saturday, Governor Andrew Cuomo said at his daily news briefing.

The state has had 4159 fatalities so far.

New Jersey, which has the second-highest number of US cases, reported a slowdown in the death rate: Fatalities rose by 71 on Sunday, compared with 200 the day before. It also reported fewer new cases, 3381, for a total of 37,505. Total deaths were 917.

Cuomo said it was too early to say if the outbreak had reached a peak in New York - the centre of the nation's outbreak.

""You could argue that you are seeing a plateauing,"" he told reporters in Albany.

""Next week they will tell you whether we are on a plateau or is it just a blip,"" he said, referring to statisticians.

Cuomo noted that New York deaths had levelled off for three days after dramatic rises - and Sunday marked the first drop. The toll on Friday was 562.

New hospitalisations dropped to 574 on Sunday from 1095, Cuomo said. He said 74 per cent of those hospitalised had been discharged.

Despite the more hopeful statistics, Cuomo said that New York's health system remained under severe strain, with some hospitals ""down to two or three ventilators.""

He said New Yorkers must continue to stay home and practice social distancing, especially the elderly and those with underlying health issues, groups that have died in the greatest numbers.

""It's an effective killer,"" he said. ""People who are very vulnerable must stay isolated and protected.""

The state had a total of about 122,000 positive cases. New York City has 67,551 cases, up 4245 in a day."

 When it comes to lockdown, space can make a huge difference to your sanity.

While farmers were carrying on with the much-needed work of keeping the country fed, they did have one advantage over most urban dwellers - room to move.

At a time when many city kids were binge-watching Netflix, wearing out their X-box controllers and driving their parents to distraction, country mums and dads could just send them outside or even enlist them into farm work.

Nathan and Kate Williams live with their four children, Toby, 14, Sophie, 12, Hugo, 10, and Monty, 6, on their sheep, beef and cropping farm a few kilometres east of Masterton.

To the Williams family the lockdown feels much like a normal weekend day.

""Other than the normal sibling rivalry, not much has changed really.""

""We've got room to separate them all if they are getting a bit tetchy with each other. They can go off and have a ride on their bike or go fishing in the stream.""

She said she didn't want to ""rub it in with those poor people in town with small sections"", but country kids did seem to have more options.

""They're good farm kids so they'll just find their own fun.""

Now that's he's 14 and able to drive some of the machinery, Toby has become his dad's right hand man.

""That's his ultimate day, to go off doing stuff with Nathan.""

Williams said the only thing the children had noticed differently under lockdown is that they don't get to see their friends.

""We're getting to that point where they're missing contact with other kids.""

Having dinner with Nathan's parents across the road used to be a regular thing, but now they have to maintain their distance.

Meanwhile, life under lockdown goes on in town, albeit under more confined circumstances.

Liz Whitehead and Mike Kai have eight people in their bubble in their urban Masterton home.

With four children and one grown-up daughter and her partner living with them in their five-bedroom house, they're making the most of a tight situation.

Whitehead said lockdown on the property hasn't been too bad, but she does need an escape.

""It's been ok, surprisingly, but we do have our moments.

""There's been a bit of arguing, but not as much as I thought there might be.""

Whitehead gets up in the dark at 5am and goes for a 90-minute walk before everybody gets up, just to get some space.

The lockdown has also brought a change of pace for the Whitehead-Kais.

The family's usually crazy-busy schedule of extra curricular activities such as competitive swimming, gymnastics, kickboxing and motocross have been suddenly knocked on the head.

But just because they're in town doesn't mean they don't get outside.

They've set up volleyball/badminton on their lawn and bought a bunch of board games before the lockdown came into force so they have had a bit to keep them busy.

Their broadband takes a hammering and they have to make allowances.

No-one's allowed on the internet while eldest daughter Sarah, 20, does her online university courses in the morning.

Whitehead says the family have been getting through enormous amounts of food and they have been baking up a storm.

""It's just boredom, they want to eat all the time.""

She reckons they have bought $1400 worth of groceries since going into lockdown.

Whitehead says what she misses most is her regular morning coffee at a cafe in town with her parents.

Her children also miss their friends but they do chat regularly online via Snapchat and Instagram.

Town or country, it seems with a bit of technology, a few games and some imagination, most Kiwi families are making lockdown work for them."

"Sixteen years ago, Melba Wilson opened her namesake Harlem restaurant, Melba's, with money that, she says, ""I saved up under my mattress."" Over the years, Melba's became a bustling neighborhood fixture, serving American comfort food.

 

But three weeks ago, the novel coronavirus pandemic took Wilson and her staff off course. Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered all New York City restaurants to close down or switch their business to takeout and delivery only. For Wilson and her staff, that order was life changing; 24 employees were laid off, and Wilson says the impact has been severe.

 

""I think we're grieving our lives as we knew it,"" Wilson told Scott Pelley. ""It's like an ongoing death. It's an ongoing grieving period. And the scary thing is we don't know when it's going to end.""

 

Wilson says she fears for the wellbeing of staff who are now unemployed, and those fears keep her up at night. ""I'm concerned about Champ, who is in his seventies,"" she said. ""I worry about Josh, one of our busboys who just found out that his girlfriend is expecting. I worry about Mohammed, who is a phenomenal cook, whose family depends on him to send money back home to Africa.""

 

Melba's is one of the 27,000 restaurants in New York City fighting for survival on takeout and delivery alone. Full-service restaurants employ over 300,000 workers in the city. Many restaurant owners, like Wilson, are hoping a federal economic stimulus package will provide some relief. But Wilson doesn't know when that relief will come or how long it will last. ""We're hoping that's going to kick in and ease some of the burden. But for how long?""

 

""I personally think that they should forgive rents for the time that we're mandated to close,"" Wilson said. ""When you look at over 300,000 employees that are out of work, that's a huge number. And we are truly the economic engine of our communities."""

55	Daily Mail UK	951379	Raven Saunt	Coronavirus home test kits 'could be unreliable', report claims	"The 17.5 million home testing kits ordered by the government to help stop the spread of coronavirus could be unreliable, according to scientists.

Boris Johnson had previously said the new tests could be a 'game changer' but UK experts have now warned that they may fail to detect up to half of Covid-19 cases.

It comes after the latest figures show that there have been 47,806 confirmed cases and 4,934 deaths across the UK.

It had been suggested that the antibody kits, which take just 20 minutes to use, were going to be made available 'within days' through retailers such as Boots and Amazon.

They were intended to identify contagion hotspots as well as to determine those who were immune from coronavirus having already contracted it.

It was hoped that they could speed up the screening of frontline workers such as NHS staff, teachers, police officers who would then be able to return to work.

But now none of the tests set to go on the market have proved to be sufficiently reliable despite many claiming an accuracy rate of more than 90 per cent.

Speaking to the Guardian, one expert said in reality the sensitivity of the tests was likely to detect just 50 to 60 per cent of those with more mild symptoms.

It comes after Health Secretary Matt Hancock himself said on Sunday that the kits were not yet 'good enough' with ministers playing down their universal effectiveness.

Mr Hancock told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show that plans to roll out the tests across the country were no longer immediate.

He said: 'We're getting the test results through every day, I was looking at some last night.

'But we still don't have any that are good enough.'

The Department of Health and Social Care has been contacted for comment."

The Cabinet Office investigation was launched last month after claims from civil servants and the resignation of Sir Philip Rutnam, the Home Office's most senior official.

He is suing the Government for constructive dismissal after accusing Ms Patel of 'swearing and belittling people'.

The results of the probe are due to be passed to the Prime Minister's Independent Adviser on Ministers' Interests Sir Alex Allan within days.

He will decide whether Ms Patel broke rules. However, the final say rests with Mr Johnson, who can overrule Sir Alex.

A Government source said Mr Johnson was 'very supportive' of his key ally. Full details of the probe are unlikely to be published in full.

Fans of Ms Patel said there had been a 'reset' between her and officials and she is working well with new Permanent Secretary Matthew Rycroft.

They also revealed Home Office relations with the police are the 'best in years'. Throughout the Covid-19 crisis, Ms Patel is hosting a daily call with police chiefs.

2068	New York Post	994995	Mike Vaccaro	Lesson of Maurice Stokes-Jack Twyman bond resonates in these coronavirus times	"The celebration was going to culminate in the 700-seat auditorium at the John F. Kennedy Student Center, tucked into the northern segment of the campus of St. Francis University in Loretto, Pa. There, Monday night, the 2,100-student school would celebrate the life of Maurice Stokes, the school’s most famous alumnus, on the 50th anniversary of his death.

“But God has his own plan,” says Rev. Malachi Van Tassell, the university’s president.

So much about the extraordinary life of Maurice Stokes must be explained, if it is to be explained at all, by those six simple words. He was a brilliant college player at St. Francis, the first player to win the MVP at the NIT from a team that didn’t win the tournament (in 1955), culminating a year in which he averaged 27.1 points and 26.2 rebounds.

He was the NBA’s rookie of the year in 1956 for the Rochester Royals, became an All-Star when that franchise moved to Cincinnati, averaged 16.4 points and 17.3 rebounds and was well on his way, at age 24, to becoming one of the greatest players in the league’s history.


But on March 12, 1958, Stokes fell and banged his head in the Royals’ regular-season finale. A few days later, on a small plane ride home from Detroit for a playoff game, he took ill. By the time he reached the hospital he was fully paralyzed, diagnosed with post-traumatic encephalopathy.

He would regain some motor skills over the years through intense physical therapy but suffered a heart attack and died on April 6, 1970, two months shy of his 37th birthday. His funeral was held at St. Francis and he is buried on campus, in the Franciscan Friar Cemetery, one of only a few lay people given their eternal rest there.

It is one of the heartbreaking stories in the history of American sports, but also one of the most redeeming, too, thanks to Stokes’ friendship with Jack Twyman. Twyman was a fellow all-star on the Royals and though the two men weren’t especially close, Stokes’ accident changed that. Twyman lived year-round in Cincinnati. Stokes’ family was in Pittsburgh. Soon after Stokes’ diagnosis, Twyman agreed to become Stokes’ legal guardian.

What followed was one of the extraordinary friendships ever formed.

One day, Jack was asked why he’d decided to make such a remarkable commitment to Maurice, and again he shrugged his shoulders and said, “Maurice needed someone. I became that someone.”

That phrase — “Become That Someone” — all these years later, has become St. Francis’ motto. And though St. Francis had to postpone its celebration of Stokes’ life, it is a message that has never seemed more relevant than it does in these turbulent, uncertain days.

“During this pandemic it’s a call for each person to become their best self,” Father Van Tassell says. “We can become that someone in any number of scenarios.”


Tim Frank was hoping to be a part of the celebration. Frank is the NBA’s senior vice president for basketball communications and he is from Altoona, Pa., less than a half-hour from St. Francis. He grew up believing Stokes was larger than life, watched Red Flash basketball games in the fieldhouse named for Stokes, looked at his retired No. 26 in the rafters there.

One of the saddest elements of Stokes’ story is that he played in the league so briefly, and even among many basketball fans his is a name that often draws blank stares. The NBA did its part to rectify that eight years ago when it created the Twyman-Stokes Award to recognize the league’s teammate of the year.

It is a poignant trophy — one figurine helping another to its feet — and the winners, who have included Chauncey Billups, Tim Duncan and Vince Carter, are invariably honored at first and then completely humbled once they read up on the award’s namesakes.

“It’s so gratifying to see that,” Frank says. “More people should know about Maurice, and more people should know about the amazing friendship he had with Jack. Especially now. This is a story that resonates.”

It does. It should. We lean on friends now as much as we ever have, more even, as much as Maurice and Jack leaned on each other. Once, late in his life, Maurice’s intense rehab yielded a small victory: he was able to regain a little flexibility in his fingers. It took him a few hours, but he finally completed his first sentence. He showed it to his friend:

“Dear Jack, how can I ever thank you?”

To which Jack immediately, and quintessentially, replied: “You may think I come here to cheer you up. But, really, it’s the other way around.”"
2068	New York Post	1034484	Joel Sherman	Mets might be MLB’s biggest loser in the coronavirus era	"There are 30 losers. Some lose less, some lose a lot more when it comes to major league teams during the coronavirus pandemic.

The Orioles lose less. They were going to have trouble drawing spectators this year. They get to run time off the horrible contracts of Alex Cobb and, especially, Chris Davis without paying them. No one of too much significance is accruing service time toward arbitration or free agency while games are not played.

The Tigers are in a similar situation, just substitute Jordan Zimmermann and Miguel Cabrera for Cobb and Davis while acknowledging that service time accruing for Matt Boyd is somewhat hurtful.

On the other side, the Dodgers are oft mentioned for being particularly hurt by games being missed and perhaps a season lost to the virus. That revolves mainly around one player — Mookie Betts. He is due to be a free agent following the 2020 season regardless and now may never play a game for the Dodgers after they traded three prospects to Boston for him, plus redirected Kenta Maeda to Minnesota.

But the Dodgers have the young talent and resources to remain a powerhouse even without the prospects or Betts. The lost revenue in the sport likely will drive down free-agent prices at least for the near future, and just a few teams, such as the Dodgers and Yankees, might have the finances to capitalize.

For the Yankees, though, part of the tolerance to stretch to nine years at $324 million for Gerrit Cole was knowing, yeah, they likely would be overpaying over the last few seasons of the contract, but they also would be getting prime years early. Now, Cole’s final season in his 20s is tick, tick, ticking away without games.

Still, the Yankees have talent and resources and — like the Dodgers — a baseball operations department that knows how to assemble a winning team.

The biggest losers are clubs that have pushed so much into the pot for this year or next and do not have strong feeder systems or the financial wherewithal to best withstand things if most or, especially all, of the 2020 major league season is lost. The three that stand out are the Cubs, Reds and Mets.

Mets GM Brodie Van WagenenCharles Wenzelberg/New York Post
The Cubs marketed their best players, such as Kris Bryant and Willson Contreras, in the offseason recognizing they needed to spread payroll around more and deepen their stock of controllable talent. But the Cubs never traded those players, who had two years of service time until free agency. So now, as their control is dwindling even as no games are being played, their value is lower, especially because more teams will lack the revenue to want to take on expensive players.

Cubs president of baseball operations Theo Epstein told me last month the team would decide by the trade deadline if it could win a title and, if not, would be realistic about moving players. Will there even be a trade deadline now with the Cubs facing the core of a champion — Bryant, Contreras, Javy Baez, Jon Lester, Anthony Rizzo and Kyle Schwarber — with expiring contracts after this season or next?

The Reds already gave away two of their better prospects (Jeter Downs and Josiah Gray) to get out of Homer Bailey’s pact last year, and the Dodgers already used Downs as a key to get Betts. The Reds also used touted prospect Taylor Trammell last July to get Trevor Bauer when they weren’t really contenders just so they would have him in his walk year this season. Now, what walk season?

Cincinnati gave matching four-year, $64 million free-agent pacts to Nick Castellanos and Mike Moustakas to try to win now. Would you bet on either aging well? Part of the calculus was at least they had 2020 with those guys to try to end a postseason drought that extends to 2013.

But the Mets might be the big losers. Let us count the ways:

They traded key prospects Jarred Kelenic, Justin Dunn, Anthony Kay and Simeon Woods Richardson for Robinson Cano, Edwin Diaz and Marcus Stroman, and they did not make the playoffs last year. Stroman, like Bauer, was obtained with his 2020 walk year in mind. So either he will pitch less in his walk year or become a free agent without pitching at all.


The trade with the Mariners, already looking disastrous with Kelenic growing into a top prospect while Cano and Diaz faltered last year, can only be revived if the Mets receive a lot out of Cano and Diaz. As one NL executive said of what missing games does to that Mets’ trade: “It takes an egregious screwup and makes it worse.”

Like Bryant and Contreras, Michael Conforto, Steven Matz and Noah Syndergaard all will be free agents after next season, and the Mets are now losing shrinking time with them. Syndergaard was going to miss this season one way or another after needing Tommy John surgery. But, again, like the Cubs with Bryant and Contreras, the Mets have missed their best window to trade Syndergaard and recoup some of the controllable inventory lost in the Cano, Diaz and Stroman deals.

Also, with no Syndergaard and with Stroman, Rick Porcello and Michael Wacha free agents, the Mets’ rotation to begin 2021 is Jacob deGrom and Matz — and Matz can leave the following offseason. The strength of the team is about to not be that.

DeGrom turns 32 in June. Like Cole with the Yankees, the Mets just don’t want to lose out on any of deGrom’s peak.

One reason the Mets could tolerate some expense and bad contracts is players such as Pete Alonso, Jeff McNeil and J.D. Davis were not yet arbitration eligible. The Mets wasted a cheap season of that trio last year and another could be flitting away now.

If there is a season, the good-faith understanding between the union and MLB is that an attempt will be made to play as many games as possible. That likely will necessitate adding doubleheaders and perhaps removing off days. I would argue that the Mets’ best 1-through-15 are as good as or better than that of any NL team except the Dodgers. And Brodie Van Wagenen has made the Mets a bit deeper than in recent seasons — especially in the bullpen if Dellin Betances is healthy, and Diaz and Jeurys Familia rebound (which was going to be key even in a 162-game campaign).


Submit questions on your favorite New York teams to be answered in an upcoming mailbag

But depth is still an issue made worse already by the loss of Syndergaard. If teams are going to need to play more games in an abbreviated period, depth is going to be more vital than ever, and depth is not a Mets stength.

One way to create depth if there is a partial 2020 season is to capitalize on an unfortunate situation — that many teams bereft of revenue might have to move contracts even for middling return. But does anyone see the Mets adding to their payroll? Whenever I ask officials around the sport which teams are in the worst financial situation, the Mets routinely come up because they have so much debt and already were going to lose a lot trying to win in 2020. Now, also the value of a franchise the Wilpons are trying to sell may be plummeting.

Might the Wilpons feel with Steve Cohen, like the Cubs with Bryant and Contreras, that their best chance to receive the most for assets — in this case a franchise — came and went in the offseason?

What could financial distress mean for the near future? The Mets can get out of walk-year players such as Stroman, Yoenis Cespedes, Jed Lowrie, Wilson Ramos, Justin Wilson and even any non-insurance payments to David Wright after 2020. But will the lack of revenues this year (even with a partial season, and especially with none) force the Mets to take their 2021 payroll down toward $100 million (or less)?

As one personnel head said, “Their track record is not wanting to spend even in good times.” In which case, can they even make a qualifying offer (roughly $18 million) to Stroman? Would they even tender a contract to Syndergaard (about $10 million) if they thought they were only going to get, say, 15-18 starts from him next year and could not trade him for much more than 25 cents on the dollar?"
55	Daily Mail UK	941110	Reuters	UK PM Johnson hospitalized for tests after persistent coronavirus...	"LONDON, April 6 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital for tests on Sunday after suffering persistent coronavirus symptoms 10 days after testing positive for the virus, though Downing Street said he remained in charge of the government.

Johnson, who was isolating in Downing Street after testing positive last month, still had a high temperature and so his doctors felt he should go to an undisclosed hospital for tests in what the government said was a ""precautionary step.""

""On the advice of his doctor, the prime minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests,"" his Downing Street office said in a statement. Johnson is expected to stay overnight.

""This is a precautionary step, as the prime minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus ten days after testing positive for the virus,"" the statement added.

News of his hospitalization came only after an hour after Queen Elizabeth delivered a rallying call to the British public saying they would overcome the coronavirus outbreak if they stayed resolute.

Johnson, 55, on March 27 became the first leader of a major power to announce that he had tested positive. He went into isolation at an apartment in Downing Street and said on Friday he was staying there as he still had a high temperature.

Downing Street underscored that this was not an emergency admission and that Johnson remained in charge of the government. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will chair the government's emergency COVID-19 meeting on Monday, a source said.

With only an unwieldy collection of sometimes ancient and contradictory precedents to go by, there is no simple, formally-enshrined ""Plan B"" or succession scenario should the prime minister become incapacitated.

The pound briefly fell 0.4% vs the U.S. dollar to $1.2215 before trimming some losses to trade at $1.2230, down 0.3%.

Queen Elizabeth had been informed of Johnson's admission to hospital, Buckingham Palace said. It made no further comment.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Johnson was a ""strong man"" as he passed on his nation's best wishes.

""All Americans are praying for him,"" Trump told a news conference. ""He's a friend of mine, he's a great gentleman and a great leader, and as you know he went to the hospital today but I'm hopeful and sure that he's going to be fine.""

Johnson, the face of the 2016 Brexit campaign, won a resounding election victory in December before leading the United Kingdom out of the European Union on Jan. 31.

But he has faced criticism in the United Kingdom for initially approving a much more modest response to the novel coronavirus outbreak than other major European leaders, telling a news conference on March 3 that he had been shaking hands with coronavirus patients.

He then changed tack when scientific projections showed a quarter of a million people could die in the United Kingdom.

Johnson effectively shuttered the world's fifth-largest economy, advising people to stay at home and the elderly or infirm to isolate themselves for weeks.

But the virus has penetrated the British government.

Johnson and his health minister tested positive last month and his chief medical adviser also self isolated. Johnson's pregnant 32-year-old fiancee, Carrie Symonds, also had symptoms but said on Saturday she was feeling better.

From an apartment above Number 11 Downing Street, and with food brought to his door, Johnson continued to lead the government's response and chaired meetings via video conference.

He has posted a series of video messages on Twitter since then, initially appearing in a suit and tie but in the latest post on Friday, he appeared weary, sitting in a chair with his shirt open at the neck.

""Although I'm feeling better and I've done my seven days of isolation, alas I still have one of the symptoms, a minor symptom, I still have a temperature,"" he said.

Britain's National Health Service guidelines stipulate that those who suspect they have coronavirus should not leave home.

Under a section headlined ""What to do if you need medical help while self-isolating,"" it says: ""If you need medical help for any reason, do not go to places like a GP (family doctor) surgery, pharmacy or hospital.""

Health officials said on Sunday the UK death toll from the coronavirus had risen by 621 to 4,934.

Downing Street refused to say what tests Johnson was to have in hospital, but experts said a person of the prime minister's age with COVID-19 symptoms after 10 days would be likely be assessed for their oxygen levels, lung, liver and heart functions, and undergo an electrocardiogram heart check.

Doctors managing COVID-19 patients had reported that more men than women had serious problems and patients who were overweight or had previous health issues were at a higher risk.

Earlier this year, Johnson said he needed to lose weight.

""We don't know exactly why the PM has gone to hospital except we have been told he is having tests,"" said Derek Hill, professor of medical imaging science at University College London.

""Many people attending hospital with COVID-19 have difficulty breathing. Some people are rapidly discharged. Some others can quickly deteriorate and need help breathing. We have no reason to believe the PM needs such help.""

2339	ComicBook	947085	Matthew Aguilar	's Charlotte Flair Beats Rhea Ripley at WrestleMania; Becomes NXT Champion	"Tonight's second night of WrestleMania action featured a stacked set of matches, but not just between WWE superstars. It also featured a bit of NXT, courtesy of NXT Champion Rhea Ripley. After accepting Rhea's challenge and flooring Ripley on her own show, tonight's contest between the Queen and the NXT Champ was highly anticipated, and it most certainly delivered. Both stars hit with power and speed right from the get-go, but after an incredibly physical match, it was Charlotte Flair who stood tall.
Ripley would attack Charlotte's back with powerful kicks and punches, while Charlotte would attack Ripley's knee, something she also did when she bumrushed Ripley on NXT.
The knee attack on Ripley worked, as even when Ripley got off some offense she would have to falter quickly to hold the knee, though she powered through it anyway.
The two kept up the pace, hitting each other with brutal punches and kicks, followed by several submission attempts. At one point though Charlotte locked in a submission that Ripley couldn't power through, and she would tap to Flair, making Flair the new NXT Champ.

Banjo Kazooie developer Rare gave fans a clever cheat code to stay at home during the coronavirus pandemic. The company took to Twitter to post a short video showing off the infamous keypad floor in the sandcastle of Treasure Trove Cove. Seasoned Banjo players will remember this area for that infectious background music and the presence of that floor tile puzzle. Solving it once yields a Jiggy, but in this clip, it serves a completely different purpose: Telling people to chill out at the house to stop the spread of the virus. Banjo even activates Invincibility Mode after entering the words.
A lot of people were digging the joke, but there are a ton of replies under it that lament the fact that gamers still don’t have any idea if or when they’ll get another Banjo game. Rare helped bring Battletoads back, but the game they are most commonly associated with lies over in the corner waiting for a return to the spotlight. Earlier this year, the company’s statue featuring the bear and the bird actually got damaged by a storm. 100 mile per hour winds knocked Kazooie’s head off the statue, but Banjo remains.
Another topic of conversation after the character’s surprise introduction to Super Smash Bros. was if Playtonic would step up to produce the long awaited core sequel to Banjo-Tooie. Well, the Yooka Laylee series producers don’t have a ton to report on that front either.
""Hey everyone, we wanted to address this speculation currently swarming our mentions,"" wrote the developer on Twitter last year. ""We hate to be the bearer of news that isn't what you want to hear, but we thought it best to come out and say -- we aren't working on a new Banjo-Kazooie game and we remain an indepedent studio.""
""While we would love to work with the bear and bird again, that ball isn't in our court. With that said, we are keen to continue progressing as a studio, carrying the experience of games we worked on, old and new, to create new characters and adventures for you to hopefully love.""
“We’re sorry if this isn’t what you wanted to hear from us, at first, we found it amusing that Ed Bryan’s bag is being used as serious ‘evidence’, but we reckon it wouldn’t be fair if we didn’t set the record straight.”

2068	New York Post	1543221	Daniel Cassady	Hasidic funerals flout social distancing rules amid coronavirus	"Hasidic Jews flouted social distancing rules and held at least two packed funerals on the streets of Brooklyn Sunday, including one for a faith-leader who died of coronavirus — as NYPD officers feebly tried to disperse the crowds by blasting warnings from their squad cars.

Video posted on Facebook shows cops driving up to dozens of mourners, sirens blaring, during a procession near 55th Street and 12th Avenue in Borough Park that was held for 78-year-old Rabbi Meir Rokeach, who reportedly died of COVID-19 on Saturday night.

“This is not six feet” an officer in a protective face mask says over the loudspeaker, as the members of the Orthodox Jewish community continue to congregate.

The officers then play a recording reminding those gathered to maintain at least a 6-foot distance while in public as a way to stem the spread of the virus.

But the masses of mourners ignored the warnings, though one man was seen approaching the patrol car to apologize.

Hours later, throngs of Hasidic Jews, some in blue face masks, attended another outdoor funeral procession about a mile away near 44th Street and 16th Avenue. Police also responded and asked the congregation to disperse.

At both of the gatherings, the funeral attendees asked for more time to grieve, and cops, “wanting to be respectful because they were in mourning,” gave them about five minutes before starting to play the recording heard in the video, an NYPD spokeswoman said.

The crowds eventually tapered off, she said. There were no arrests or citations issued in either incident.

The events were held just days after another Hasidic Jewish funeral on Avenue N near East 9th Street in Midwood.

Last month, members of New York City’s Hasidic and Orthodox Jewish community openly violated social distancing orders by hosting raucous Brooklyn weddings with hundreds of guests amid the growing spread of the bug.

But since then, community leaders have maintained that social distancing orders are largely being followed with every major synagogue closed, even as Passover approaches this week.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo has barred crowds of 50 or more and President Trump has said Americans should avoid events with more than 10 people amid the outbreak, which has infected 64,955 and killed 2,472 in the Big Apple alone as of Sunday evening."
2068	New York Post	946095	Associated Press	NJ gives local governments power to limit short-term rentals	"TRENTON, N.J. — New powers for New Jersey’s local and county governments to restrict short-term rentals are taking effect Sunday night, part of the effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 as the number of cases in the state passed 37,000 and the number of deaths exceeded 900.

The state’s emergency management director, state police Col. Patrick Callahan, issued an administrative order aimed at hotels, motels, guest houses and private residences.

The additional local authority does not extend to people housed under a state-led shelter effort, to those in temporary residence under emergency or other housing assistance, or to health care workers staying somewhere on a temporary basis.

Gov. Phil Murphy said shore communities have reported people trying to temporarily relocate there from areas hard-hit by the coronavirus spread, but those communities can lack the health care infrastructure that a surge in patients would require.

Murphy urged state residents to remain in their primary residences during the COVID-19 crisis."
2068	New York Post	1117948	Virginia Backaitis	Four important lessons for working from home	"Welcome to the new world of working from home. Sure, there’s no commute, but there’s also no barista, no going out for lunch, no reason to get dressed up. What we’re discovering is that it can be awkward, but also full of heart and, sometimes, even funny.

Lesson 1: Juggling kids and work has never been trickier

Consider what “shelter in place” looks like for 35-year-old Erin Butler and her family in Ho-Ho-Kus, NJ. Butler has climbed the rungs of Citrix’s corporate ladder for the past 14 years, so handling her responsibilities shouldn’t be a problem, even if it’s really busy. (Citrix provides remote digital workspaces, among other things.)

But add a 2- and a 5-year-old, minus the grandparents, who usually help out but are isolating, and you find Butler and her husband waking up to discuss coordinating conference- call schedules as well as creating timetables for feeding, nurturing and entertaining their kids.

When neither is available, they pull out the Little Tikes bounce house. “It can keep them busy for quite a while,” Butler says. Desperate times call for desperate measures.”

With both of them home 24/7, Butler also decided now was a good time to potty train their almost 3-year-old son. His desire to make a big-boy poop came while Dad was on an important call and Mom was in a virtual conference. “What could I do? I hit mute and took him to the bathroom. Thank God I didn’t have the video on,” she says.

Lesson 2: The video conference call is a minefield

One enterprising software salesman would tell us his work-from-home story only if we agreed not to use his real name. The 41-year-old was on a Zoom video call when his partner ran buck naked from the shower to the bedroom. “I was the one speaking. All eyes were on me. There’s no way that my boss and team didn’t notice the nudity,” he says.

But “Jones” went on with the call as if nothing had happened, which is exactly the right thing to do, says etiquette coach Maggie Adams.

“There’s no need to put others in an awkward situation,” she says.

Life coach Marie Singer, from Florham Park, NJ, says there’s no need to get too upset about something like this. “Everyone is working from home and staying in place; it is an unnatural situation,” she says. “All kinds of unusual and unpredictable things are going to happen.”

Suzy Shugg, CEO of Teleplus Healthcare and clinical lipid specialist at NJ Cardiology Associates, discovered this to be true while working from home and caring for her husband, who had COVID-19.

Shugg had taken one of the few gaps in her schedule to jump into the shower before a conference call that she believed was audio-only. When she joined it half-dressed and looked at her computer screen, she was shocked — the camera was on and pointed at her crotch.

“There was the lower half of my body covered only by bright pink underwear,” she says. She grabbed a blanket, adjusted the camera and rejoined the conversation as if nothing had happened. Although at first she was alarmed, “I now think it’s funny,” says Shugg. “There’s other stuff going on if you want to get upset.”

And no, the answer isn’t to turn off the camera for group calls — it implies that you’re doing something else and don’t think the others on the call are worth your undivided attention, says Adams.

Lesson 3: Finding your own space is key

Lynn Smith, anchor of CNN’s 10 a.m. program “On the Story,” always thought that working from home in her profession was impossible. The pandemic has proven her wrong. Now she is doing her show from her home’s “basement bureau” via her phone and some bright lights.

On weekday mornings, just before 8:50 a.m., Smith tells her 4-year-old son that it’s time to go outside for recess (or to the garage if it’s inclement weather) before she starts work. Her husband or their au pair watches him and their other 1-year-old son while they play.

“Sometimes they send me texts while I’m doing the show, asking if they can come in the house yet,” says Smith.

She spends time with the boys after the show, but before retreating to her closet to make phone calls, interview and write scripts for the next day. “It’s the only place in the house that is quiet,” she says.

There is an upside, though. “Usually, I leave the house around 4 a.m.,” she says. “Now I’m here when everyone wakes up. It’s nice.”

Charly Rok, a vice president at Edelman, takes it all in stride. She’s been answering phone calls while sitting on the bathroom floor or in her building’s stairwell. “My husband and I both have loud voices, and we live in a loft,” she says.

Lesson 4: You need to have a bit of give and take

Some space-sharers have created an imaginary co-worker to blame things on. Why fight with your roommate or significant other about empty coffee pots, dirty mugs left in the sink or the printer being out of ink when you can blame Jim, that lazy old slug?

And sometimes, the rest of the household needs some downtime regardless of your schedule. Jennifer Barish, an office manager at Woodbury, NY-based small business loan provider Lendio, now works from her aunt and uncle’s kitchen table in Lindenhurst, NY.

On March 26, her uncle and cousin spent the afternoon in the living room celebrating baseball’s opening day — taped from a previous year, that is — complete with Mets jerseys, hot dogs and general ballpark revelry.

“I love baseball,” she says, reckoning her employer would understand even if her full attention wasn’t on her work.

Says Singer: “For now, we all have to be flexible.”"

Manchester City defender Kyle Walker apologized Sunday and faces disciplinary action from the team after he reportedly defied lockdown conditions by throwing a tawdry party amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The Sun reported that he held a party involving two sex workers at his home last week, breaking the British government’s rules on social distancing. The country has been in the middle of a three-week lockdown due to coronavirus.

“I want to take this opportunity to issue a public apology for the choices I made last week which have resulted in a story today (Sunday) about my private life in a tabloid newspaper,” Walker said in a statement. “I understand that my position as a professional footballer brings the responsibility of being a role model. As such, I want to apologize to my family, friends, football club, supporters and the public for letting them down.
“My actions in this matter are in direct contrast to what I should have been doing regarding the lockdown,” Walker added. “I want to reiterate the message: Stay home, stay safe.”
Manchester City, one of the English Premier League’s top clubs, announced it will look into Walker’s conduct.

“Manchester City FC are aware of a story in a tabloid newspaper regarding the private life of Kyle Walker in relation to a breach of the UK lockdown and social distancing rules. Footballers are global role models, and our staff and players have been working to support the incredible efforts of the NHS (National Health Service) and other key workers in fighting the effects of the COVID-19 coronavirus, in any way we can. Kyle’s actions in this matter have directly contravened these efforts.

Thomas Metzmacher had to get creative to keep his business open in Germany during the coronavirus pandemic.
After toying with the idea of a delivery service, he instead turned his half-timbered restaurant in Frankfurt into a makeshift drive-thru.
“The restaurant had to close, nobody was allowed to sit inside anymore, so it was either give up or fight,” he said. “I decided to fight.”
Metzmacher was faced with the prospect of having to shut down his traditional German restaurant specializing in a traditional tart hard cider because of German regulations prohibiting groups of people from gathering amid the pandemic.

Late last year — long before most people had heard of the new coronavirus now sweeping the globe — scientists in Germany jumped into action to develop a test for the virus that originated in China.
They had one by mid-January — and labs around the country were ready to start using it just weeks later, around the same time that Europe’s most populous country registered its first case.
“It was clear that if the epidemic swept over here from China, then we had to start testing,” said Hendrik Borucki, a spokesman for Bioscientia Healthcare, which has operated 19 labs in Germany.
That quick work stood in stark contrast to delays and missteps in some other countries. “The reason why we in Germany have so few deaths at the moment compared to the number of infected can be largely explained by the fact that we are doing an extremely large number of lab diagnoses,” said virologist Dr. Christian Drosten, whose team developed the first test for the new virus at Berlin’s Charité hospital — established over 300 years ago to treat plague victims.

Metzmacher’s Zum Lahmen Esel restaurant, which has been in operation since 1807, meanwhile, normally would seat 200 people inside and another 200 in an outdoor garden.
Now, cars have driven up to a small booth in front of the restaurant, where one of Metzmacher’s 36 employees took each order before pushing a plastic tub down a makeshift slide to the car’s window to take payment at a safe distance. Driving ahead, customers would get their orders in another tub pushed to their window.
“It’s going great,” Metzmacher said. “My regulars are supporting me, they’re really happy I’m open.”
CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Without people sticking around for a few more of the signature ciders, profit margins have been low -- but Metzmacher said it’s better than nothing.
“At least we’re carrying on and we’re continuing to work,” he said.

133	Seeking Alpha	1467657	Tech Junkie	Danaher: Closing Of Cytiva Is A Positive	"The deal was officially closed on 31 March 2020, with GE Biopharma segment named as Cytiva and as an independent standalone company within Danaher's life sciences segment.

My last article on Danaher discuss how the GE Biopharma deal would be a positive for the company.

In my last article on Danaher (DHR) about 3 months ago, I discussed how the GE Biopharma deal would turn out to be a positive move for Danaher and its shareholders. The GE Biopharma is a strong performing business segment with high recurring revenue, high margin, strong revenue growth and access to key markets and that GE is only selling the segment to pay off its huge corporate debt. Since then, Danaher’s share price has dropped by around 15% due to the stock market crash and the acquisition has finally closed after a protracted journey. In this article, I will cover in greater depth on the GE Biopharma business and how it complements Danaher’s existing portfolio.

The deal was first announced on 25 Feb 2019 that Danaher would be acquiring GE’s Biopharma business for a cash purchase price of approximately $21.4B, with net purchase price after anticipated tax benefits at $20.0B. The announcement was received positively by the market with both GE and Danaher’s share prices going up on the day. This was due to a win-win situation where GE found a great opportunity for them to reduce their debt position. For Danaher, this deal further strengthens their Life Sciences segment, with GE Biopharma’s best-in-class bioprocessing technologies and solutions providing an excellent complement to their current biologics’ workflow solutions.

After a long-protracted journey to obtain regulatory approval, which included Danaher selling parts of its portfolio to Sartorius AG, the deal was finally completed on 31 March. The Biopharma segment will be named as Cytiva and be a standalone operating company within Danaher’s life sciences segment.

With the divestiture of its dental unit, Envista (NVST), Danaher now retains 3 main operating segments: life sciences, diagnostics, and environmental & applied science. This article will focus on the life sciences segment as this is where Cytiva will be part of.

Under its life sciences segment, the company offers a broad range of research tools that scientists use to study the basic building blocks of life in order to understand the causes of disease, identify new therapies and test new drugs and vaccines. The life sciences segment market its products under the Beckman Coulter, IDT, Leica Microsystems, Molecular Devices, Pall, Phenomenex, and Sciex brands and consists of the following business:

Bioprocess refers to the process are biopharmaceuticals are being manufactured and there are 3 main components in the manufacturing process: upstream bioprocessing, downstream bioprocessing, and filtration. Cytiva’s main revenue generator comes from its bioprocess business, which is about $2.8b in revenue, where it has a strong upstream portfolio with its cell culture media and single-use bioreactor offering. It also has a leadership position in downstream bioprocessing, driven by its chromatography resins and hardware portfolio. Its protein A resin is widely adopted in almost all the leading monoclonal antibodies globally. Cytiva’s product was used in more than 75% of all biopharmaceuticals approved by the FDA in2019.

The business also provides end-to-end bioprocess solutions via its Enterprise Solution where its KUBio prefabricated manufacturing facility and configurable FlexFactory bioprocessing platform to reduce the time taken for companies to build a new facility from scratch. This has allowed them to penetrate the increasingly lucrative Chinese market, which is growing at an unprecedented pace. Notable clients include Lonza, BeiGene (BGNE) and Pfizer (PFE). While being strong in both upstream and downstream bioprocessing, Cytiva has almost no presence in the filtration space. Danaher has traditionally been operating in the filtration space with the acquisition of Pall which should complement Cytiva’s portfolio in the bioprocess space very nicely.

The cell and gene therapy space has grown exponentially with the landmark approvals of several innovative therapies to cure previously incurable diseases. Cytiva have also managed to capitalize on the growth, particularly in cell therapies where the business offer end-to-end solution to automate the manufacturing of cell therapies, which is a critical part of successful cell therapies. Both Novartis (NVS) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) have adopted Cytiva’s solution to manufacture their approved CAR-Ts. Cytiva has also expanded its Enterprise Solution to the cell therapy space as well. Similarly, Danaher’s Pall complements nicely in the gene therapy space, where Cytiva’s offering is less complete.

Lastly, Cytiva’s genomics and cellular research should be complementary to the rest of Danaher’s life sciences platform where they serve biology researches. An example is how it is enabling the rapid diagnostics of the COVID-19.

At the time of announcement of the deal, GE Biopharma was expected to deliver 6-7% core revenue growth. In its Q4 earnings call, Danaher acknowledged that the business had actually outperformed expectations in 2019. While the company still does not have enough visibility to raise 2020’s guidance, the strong performance clearly outlined the underlying strength of the business.

Furthermore, the biopharmaceuticals and cell and gene therapy markets, which are key markets that Cytiva sells to, are both expected to grow in the coming years. As mentioned earlier, Cytiva complements Danaher’s existing life sciences segment very nicely and the acquisition should help create more synergy to the end markets.

Cytiva’s key competitors including Thermo Fisher (TMO), Sartorius, MilliporeSigma and Danaher’s Pall all reported very strong results and outlook recently. This clearly shows that the end market is strong with a favorable tailwind.

Lastly, the deal was completed at approximately 17x of EBITDA, which compares favorably to other deals conducted by competitors. For instance, Danaher’s acquisition of Pall was completed at 22x of EBITDA and Thermo Fisher’s acquisition of Qiagen is expected to be at around 19x of EBITDA.

Danaher has always been a well-run company that has consistently delivered outstanding long-term shareholders returns. With the Danaher Business System as their playbook, the company has an excellent track record in improving the operations and performance of companies they acquired. Cytiva offers an avenue for Danaher to double down on life sciences, with its high recurring revenue and margin meaning that it is already outperforming the other operating companies within Danaher.

Cytiva also adds a complementary portfolio which adds synergy and gives Danaher access to key markets. On a macro level, the biopharmaceuticals and cell and gene therapy are expected to grow, and its key competitors have also reported strong results and outlook recently. While the COVID-19 pandemic has caused supply chain disruptions globally, there should not be a demand issue moving forward given that Danaher’s offerings are used to make innovative and life-saving therapies across several modalities. In summary, I believe that the acquisition of Cytiva is a big positive for Danaher. Coupled with the company’s track record in outperforming the market, I would rate Danaher a buy.

As always, investors should conduct their own due diligence and consider their risk appetites and time horizon before taking up any position. This is especially so, given the recent market turmoil resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

1551	The Sun - UK	1723850	Fionnuala O'leary	New York Mayor Bill de Blasio enjoys a park stroll WITHOUT a mask despite CDC recommendations	"NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio was spotted running in a park without a mask Saturday despite the CDC recommendation to wear a ""cloth face covering.""

News of his stroll in Prospect Park emerged on Twitter - two days after he advised New Yorkers to ""wear a face covering when you go outside"" to curb the spread of  COVID-19.

""This is not 'put on a face covering and you can't get get the coronavirus,'"" De Blasio had warned, emphasizing the need for social distancing and staying home. ""It's an advisory based on new evidence.""

The CDC has said clothing coverings to slow the spread of the killer bug amongst people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it.

But the mayor was forced to address his most recent 11-mile dash to the Brooklyn park with his wife, Chirlane McCray, via their Upper East Side home in Gracie Mansion at a press briefing Sunday.

""Everyone who needs some exercise should get the exercise for the amount of time they need and then get back to home or work if they're doing essential work,"" de Blasio curtly told reporters.

He said the City's top doc Dr Barbot confirmed wearing a ""face covering"" was only necessary ""if you might get less than six feet from people.""

The mayor said the ""homemade"" scarf or bandana he previously recommended wasn't necessary if you're alone on a street, or with people you live with.

""I bring the scarf up over my mouth and nose as I was trained to do,"" he said when quizzed by a second journalist. ""You don't have to wear it every minute if there's no one near you, but you bring it up if you need it.""

A New York Times journalist tweeted that he saw the mayor and McCray were ""both unmasked"" in Prospect Park before clarifying that no one was within 20 feet of them.

""But it would have been hard to get there without walking thru [sic] a much more crowded part, tho [sic] they could have been driven there,"" Andy Newman noted.

""I saw him too and was so angry,"" another park goer replied, posting a video which appeared to show the mayor and his wife apparently without the face covering De Blasio suggested.

The NYC politician previously came under fire when eagle-eyed residents saw him out and about in the Brooklyn beauty spot last weekend, after telling everyone else to stay indoors.

He also reportedly worked out at a Brooklyn YMCA in March - immediately before the state announced mass business closures, including gyms.

President Donald Trump has also suggested people wear something like a scarf to stop the community spread of the virus, which has infected over 300,000 Americans and killed more than 9,000 people.

1478	Stuff	1684845	Catherine Harris	Coronavirus: Cash payments to citizens 'can't be ruled out'	"Sweden is in stark contrast to neighbouring European countries who have entered into lockdown.

""Helicopter money"" – cash payments to all citizens – cannot be ruled out in New Zealand's current coronavirus crisis, a fund manager believes.

Matthew Goodson, co-managing director of Salt Funds Management, said he would not rule out the Government handing out untagged cash to its citizens, echoing a huge relief package in the US.

President Trump has approved an historic aid package which included direct payments of $1200 to most American adults earning US$75,000 or less, and US$500 per child.

Goodson said the Reserve Bank had ""very much come to the party,"" keeping credit flowing with its bond purchasing programme and term loan facilities to banks.

The difficulty was translating that from the financial markets to the real economy, and into people's hands.

Goodson said he was in no doubt the current crisis was ""going to be an economic shock rivalling the Great Depression"" and coming out of lockdown would be a ""balancing act"".

""Because you can't stay in lockdown forever, because unemployment kills people too.

""So that's going to be a key question for financial markets, is at what point does Government start to shift that balance a little bit.""

Brad Olsen, a senior economist with Infometrics, said he felt there was a case for helicopter money, such as a one-off tax rebate, but not right now.

""With New Zealand still in a lockdown, people have nothing to spend on aside from food and essential items, but once we come out of lockdown is where the assistance is best targeted to get the maximum impact into the economy.""

""Post-lockdown, I'd expect that households will be much more cautious about their spending, and will cut back spending to only the essentials.""

Helicopter money would be helpful in encouraging people back into discretionary spending such as eating out, movies and trips away.

At the moment, however, Olsen said the Government's stimulus was focused rightly on keeping people in work, ""essentially keeping the economy on life support"".

At Alert Level 2 and 3 there would be a period of adjustment and after the lockdown, there would be a recovery phase, and ""that's where a focus on getting households to spend more becomes most important"".

Stuff has reached out to Finance Minister Grant Robertson for comment.

Political economist Associate Professor Brian Roper of Otago University said it was important to remember that the pandemic was not going to last forever.

""It's only going to last for a couple of years.

""But the economic ramifications are likely to be felt for at least a decade down the track, especially taking into account the increase in government debt.

""And following that, what's going to have to be a sustained period of austerity to pay that debt down.""

Roper believes the global economy was already vulnerable before Covid-19 came along, with share prices out of sync with low levels of economic growth.

""Bull runs don't last forever. I think Wall St was overdue for a crash anyhow.""

That was partly due to factors that had underpinned the global financial crisis in 2008 never truly going away. Big surges in property prices and high levels of global debt had preceded the GFC as well.

 

 ""As the IMF pointed out, in 2016 global debt reached its highest point in human history. A lot of those trends were just playing out again."""

1476	Straits Times	941192		Trump voices hope for 'leveling-off' of coronavirus in US hot spots	"WASHINGTON (REUTERS, AFP) - US President Donald Trump on Sunday (April 5) expressed hope that the United States was seeing a ""leveling-off"" of the coronavirus crisis in some of the nation's hot spots for the viral outbreak.

New York, the hardest-hit state, reported on Sunday that for the first time in a week deaths had fallen slightly from the day before, but there were still nearly 600 new fatalities and more than 7,300 new cases.

""Maybe that's a good sign,"" Mr Trump told reporters, referring to the drop in fatalities.

Trump also said he was “hopeful and sure” Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was hospitalised for further coronavirus tests after testing positive, would recover from Covid-19.

“He is a friend of mine, he is a great gentleman, a great leader. He was brought to the hospital today but I am hopeful and sure that he is going to be fine,” Trump said at his White House briefing. “He is a strong man, a strong person.”"
1476	Straits Times	941192		Oil plunges as meeting delay raises doubts for price war truce	"SYDNEY (BLOOMBERG) - Crude fell sharply in Asia on Monday (April 6) after a delay to a planned meeting of top producers to discuss output curbs raised doubts over the prospects for an agreement.

Brent futures dropped as much as 12 per cent, after jumping almost 14 per cent on Friday. The Opec+ bloc including Russia will hold a virtual gathering on April 9 instead of Monday after fresh divisions emerged. Saudi Arabia and Russia have indicated that they want the U.S. to join any agreement, but President Donald Trump had only hostile words for Opec on Saturday, and threatened tariffs on foreign oil.

State oil producer Saudi Aramco has delayed until Thursday an announcement on its official selling prices for May, according to people with knowledge of the situation, to await signs of what may happen at the meeting. That comes as the International Energy Agency said that the deepest production cuts in the oil industry's history wouldn't be enough to steady a crude market in which demand has been ravaged by the coronavirus.

""The likelihood of a deal being done is extremely low,"" said Daniel Hynes, senior commodities strategist at ANZ Bank. ""Certainly the type of agreement you'd need to stabilize the market is a long shot given how much demand had been hit.""

Brent crude fell US$2.14 a barrel to US$31.97 at 6:52am Singapore time after earlier dropping to as low as US$30.03. The contract's six-month contango widened to US$5.58 a barrel from US$3.96 on Friday.

West Texas Intermediate futures in New York declined 7.3 per cent to US$26.28 a barrel after earlier dropping as much as 11 per cent.

Brent futures rallied 37 per cent last week, while WTI ended the week up 32 per cent, as Riyadh and Moscow appeared to move toward a resolution to their damaging battle for market share. Prices are still less than half the levels at the start of the year, with the coronavirus crisis crushing demand."

up a nurse from the civic-run Naidu Hospital, which has been treating COVID-19 patients, and applauded the work done by the hospital staff to fight the pandemic, a civic official said on Saturday.

Nurse Chhaya Jagtap received a call from the Prime Minister's Office on Friday evening, the health official from the Pune Municipal Corporation said.

An audio recordingof their conversation went viral on social media.

Starting the conversation in Marathi, Modi enquired about her wellbeing and asked Jagtap how was she allaying her family's fears for her safety, while serving COVID-19 patients with devotion.

""Yes, I am concerned about my family, but one has to work. We have to serve patients in this situation. I am managing,"" she said.

The Prime Minister went on to ask her if patients who are admitted in the hospital got scared.

""We try and speak to them. We tell them not to get scared and assure them that nothingis going to happen to them and that their reports will come out negative, she said.

The staff tries to boost the morale of positive patients too, she is heard saying in the audio clip.

Jagtap informed Modi that seven COVID-19 have been discharged from the hospital after being cured.

When Modi asked her if she had a message for lakhs of medical staff working tirelessly in various hospitals, Jagtap said, ""There is no need to be scared. We have to drive this disease out and we have to make our country win. This should be the motto of hospitals and staff."" 



The Prime Minister congratulated Jagtap for her devotion and service.

""Like you, there are lakhs of nurses, paramedical staff, doctors, who like true 'tapaswis', are serving patients in various hospitals in the country right now. I would like to congratulate you. I am happy to have heard your experiences,"" Modi said.

Expressing her gratitude, Jagatp said, ""I am just doing my duty but you are serving the nation round the clock. We should be grateful to you."" 



The country is fortunate to have a Prime Minister like him, she is heard saying in the audio clip.

The civic-run Naidu Hospital has been treating majority of COVID-19 patients from Pune."

It had even got approval from the state-level high-powered steering committee for smart cities mission to implement the project at a cost of Rs 12.92 crore.Shortly after getting the approval, the civic body floated the first tender in last July, a corporation official said. “But we received no response. Two bidders expressed interest in the fourth attempt, but we had to reject them as they were not qualified. A bidder who participated when we launched the last tender was rejected due to lack of technical expertise,” he said.This prompted the corporation to shelve the project for the time being and concentrate on the remaining projects.As lake beautification projects are implemented for the first time in the state, companies are reluctant to come forward as they don’t have prior experience.Meanwhile, the corporation will focus on its primary duties and disinfecting the city until the Covid-19 scare is over, the official added.

74	Business Insider	2381766	Sean Czarnecki	Experts reveal how the coronavirus will reshape the PR industry, from boosting internal communications to strengthening digital firms	"The coronavirus will materially change the public relations industry in the long run, industry insiders said.Mergers and acquisitions could pick up as small, independent firms struggle.Firms specializing in digital PR will benefit as companies look to experts to bolster their reputation.The coronavirus crisis underscored the need for internal communications, which will remain important.Click here for more BI Prime stories.



The coronavirus pandemic will ravage some public relations firms and benefit others in the short term, but the effects of this crisis will be felt far into the future.Art Stevens, managing partner of The Stevens Group, a mergers and acquisitions consultancy focused on the PR industry, said clients focused on hard-hit sectors like tourism, hospitality and restaurants have lost upwards of 70% of their revenue, forcing them to layoff or furlough staff, reduce salaries, and plead with their landlords to reduce their rent.""Everyone is grappling with this crisis and trying to stay alive,"" he said.Meanwhile, some public affairs PR firms are doing better than ever as state legislatures pass rules and regulations to slow the spread of the virus, he said.Dealmaking could pick up as small firms struggle to surviveBefore the coronavirus pandemic struck, PR was consolidating at a faster rate than in past years, according to Phillip Palazzo, founder of Palazzo Investment Bankers. This trend was driven by private equity, reflated capital markets, lowered interest rates and an expanding economy.



There were 18 completed acquisitions of PR firms in the first few months of 2020, more than double the amount in the year-ago period, said Michael Lasky, an attorney at Davis & Gilbert.Dealmaking has paused as buyers and sellers wait for the economy to stabilize.However, as small, independent firms struggle to survive the economic downturn, other PR experts predict an uptick in consolidation across the industry.An independent PR agency CEO who asked to be anonymous said at least a dozen PR firms have reached out in recent weeks to gauge the CEO's interest in buying them. Instead of presenting a ""poker face,"" the prospective sellers were open about their overhead and payroll.""They know they can't waste time,"" the CEO said.



While experiential firms struggle, digitally focused agencies will benefitThe pandemic has hit experiential PR firms hard, but firms that specialize in digital PR will benefit as companies lean on online channels to manage their communications and reputation.""There are firms focused on experiential that are experiencing significant pain,"" Palazzo said. ""Meanwhile, if you're digital only, it's almost business as usual, with very little change in client spend.""The pandemic will speed business leaders' use of social as a way to speak with a clear, consistent message to customers, stakeholders, and employees, said Roy Tristan, COO of digital at Edelman.The crisis could cement the importance of internal communicationsInternal comms was already gaining importance in response to the rise of employee activism and social media as a place where workers can voice their beliefs and objections. But lately, companies have doubled down on efforts to keep their employees informed about business strategy, what they're doing to ensure their health and safety, and how their operations are affected.""'Our people are our most valuable asset' has become a kind of nice leadership cliché,"" said Steve Astle, senior adviser and west coast lead for employee engagement firm Gagen MacDonald. ""This week, employees at Instacart, Amazon and elsewhere showed the world that there's nothing nice about it – it's just an indisputable fact.""



Astle said internal comms used to focus on sending out open enrollment packets and telling employees about changes in company travel policy, and sees it playing a bigger and more strategic role.""Now and for the foreseeable future, people responsible for employee communications need business acumen and strategic thinking skills – muscles many of them are going to have to develop in a hurry,"" he said.Insiders predict the industry will rebound by Q4Analyst Michael Nathanson predicted the ad industry would shrink by 10.6%, or almost $26 billion this year. But consultants that serve the PR industry think PR will be less scathed.Stevens said after a short-term hit, PR would rebound as clients seek out counsel and comms support even as they dial down their advertising.Edelman CEO Richard Edelman, whose earnings serve as a bellwether for the industry, said business was coming back in China, where his agency just won four clients in late March.



""Communications is now more important than advertising,"" Edelman said. ""People want facts and credible spokespeople."""

   April McGhee and her teenage daughter started feeling sick last month. They had coughs, sore throats and fevers. Her daughter's condition became so bad that they went to the emergency room.
   ""She had it worse than I did,"" McGhee said. ""Her cough lasted longer. It was really a concern. ... It was like a dry, nonproductive, hacking cough.""
   McGhee, who lives in Sacramento, wanted both of them to get tested for the coronavirus. But the hospital told her they weren't sick enough to qualify for testing under California's rules. So, they went home and into isolation.
   
   

   A single mom, McGhee makes ends meet by delivering groceries for Instacart and meals for Postmates. She contacted Instacart to apply for sick pay under a policy the company recently put in place because of the pandemic.
   ""They basically laughed me off,"" McGhee said. ""They said, 'Unless you have the health department or [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] making you stay home on quarantine, or a note from the doctor saying that you've been diagnosed with COVID-19, you're out of luck.'""
   Gig companies like Instacart, Uber and Lyft connect people who need tasks done with workers willing to do them. But the companies consider these workers independent contractors, not employees. The firms generally do not provide paid sick leave or other employee benefits.
      
   

   Now, however, that's changing. The nature of the work that Instacart shoppers, Uber and Lyft drivers and other gig workers do puts them in close contact with strangers. They are, in essence, on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic, and some of them are getting sick.
   McGhee joined other Instacart workers who walked off the job Monday to demand better safety measures. She says the company's policy not only puts her at risk, it encourages people who are sick to keep working and, potentially, spread the disease.
   She said the company should keep its workers healthy ""as a buffer zone instead of as a Typhoid Mary.""
   Instacart has since announced it plans to distribute supplies, including masks, hand sanitizer and thermometers, to workers beginning this week.
   Workers for other gig companies are also running into hurdles getting the help they've been promised.
   
   

   After Uber and Lyft driver Khadim Diop fell ill with a fever and sore throat, he got a letter from New York City's health department saying he must stay home for 14 days.
   He showed the letter to both companies to receive sick pay. He hoped it would cover the loss of the roughly $1,000 to $1,500 he says he typically makes per week. He got $250 from Lyft.
   Uber initially rejected his claim, saying he did not qualify for the company's financial assistance program. Uber said it has paid more than 1,400 claims to U.S. drivers in less than three weeks.
   But after NPR contacted Uber, the company reversed its decision regarding Diop. It said his claim should not have been rejected. He has now received about $1,700 from Uber to cover the two weeks of work he's missed.
   That's money he sorely needs.
   ""To be honest, right now, I'm very broke,"" Diop said.
   Uber does not require drivers to get tested for the coronavirus to get paid leave. They can show a doctor's note telling them to isolate themselves to prevent the virus from spreading.
   But Uber's policy does not cover drivers who choose not to work because they're afraid of getting sick.
   ""I have bad lungs already. I'm borderline diabetic. I have high blood pressure,"" said Steve Gregg, an Uber driver in the Bay Area who stopped driving about three weeks ago. ""Getting in that car felt like Russian roulette.""
   Gregg got a note from his doctor explaining his preexisting conditions, but Uber denied his claim. 
   Gregg is now looking elsewhere for help. He's applied for unemployment benefits, which are now available to gig workers under a law Congress passed last month. There are concerns, however, that states cannot process those claims quickly. U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., has called on on the U.S. Labor Department to issue detailed guidance as quickly as possible.
   Editor's note: Lyft and Uber are among NPR's sponsors."
1260	The Mirror	1901882	Ryan Merrifield	Fears were growing over PM on isolation day 10 as aides said he ‘looks dreadful’	"Boris Johnson ""looked dreadful"" before being taken to hospital with persistent coronavirus symptoms - 10 days after being diagnosed with the killer bug, his aides said.

Downing Street has confirmed the PM was taken for testing on Sunday night and is understood to still be suffering with a fever.

Covid-19 is said to have hit the 55-year-old ""like a sledgehammer"" while pregnant fiancee Carrie Symonds, 32, has spent the last week in bed with the virus.

Mr Johnson insisted in recent days he was feeling better, but insiders said the disease ""had really slammed him"".

Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who has already recovered after testing positive last week, said yesterday he was unsure if the PM had seen a doctor during his quarantine in Downing Street.

But he was adamant the PM was ""okay"" though still had a temperature and had been taken to hospital - believed to be in central London - as a precaution.

Aides said he was ""coughing and spluttering"" on video conference calls in recent days, and has failed to shake off other symptoms.

Virus experts have warned patients could develop pneumonia if they still have a high temperature for more than a week - with Mr Johnson having been due to finish isolation on Friday.

But still in the grips of the disease, he instead stayed holed up at home, in line with official guidance.

Referring to the Prime Minister, Mr Hancock told Sky News: ""He’s okay, I’ve been talking to him every day, often several times a day, throughout this, throughout the time that both of us were off and so he has very much got his hand on the tiller but he has still got a temperature.

""In a way it shows this virus affects different people differently.""

The health secretary went on to say he had been ""lucky"" having felt ""pretty rough"" briefly before recovering.

He said there can be a distinct contrast with how the virus affects different people, admitting his was clearly very mild but then ""for others it's very, very serious"".

However, he was quick to add: ""The Prime Minister is not at that end of the spectrum.""

Meanwhile, Ms Symonds - understood to be in the couple's south London apartment while Mr Johnson is at No 10 - tweeted over the weekend that she was ""on the mend"".

Mr Hancock added the PM has still been hard at work during his quarantine and was leading by example in remaining isolated as he was still showing symptoms.

Mr Johnson tweeted earlier to thank everyone who is ""saving lives by staying at home this weekend"".

""I know it's tough, but if we all work together and follow the guidance we will beat coronavirus.""

A Downing Street spokesperson said yesterday evening: “On the advice of his doctor, the Prime Minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests.

“This is a precautionary step, as the Prime Minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus ten days after testing positive for the virus.

“The Prime Minister thanks NHS staff for all of their incredible hard work and urges the public to continue to follow the Government’s advice to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.”

Mr Johnson is in a London NHS hospital, where he will remain as long as necessary, Sky News reports.

GP Dr Sarah Jarvis told the BBC it is likely the PM has ""moderate"" symptoms of coronavirus.

""The majority of people who develop coronavirus will have mild symptoms - that's probably 80% or so,"" she said.

""The older you become the more likely it is that you will become severely unwell with this.

""There is a severe stage, a moderate stage and a critical stage.""

Dr Jarvis, who is not Mr Johnson's doctor, added: ""Given he is staying in charge of the Government, that suggests to me that he probably has moderate disease but that, as a precaution, he is being taken in to check the oxygen levels in his blood, to do X-rays and probably scans of his chest.

""And to do blood tests to see for instance what his white cell counts look like and what his liver functions look like.""

Foreign Secretary  Dominic Raab  is likely to chair the daily Covid-19 meeting later today for ministers and officials in the Prime Minister's absence.

Despite the PM's tweet reassuring the nation he was okay, a source told  Daily Mail : ""It has hit him hard, really slammed him but it's in his nature to put the bravest face on it.""

It is also said the internal doors between No 10 and No 11 have been closed.

Officials have even moved tables against them to block them completely.

Food is reportedly brought on a tray from No 10 and left outside the ground floor office in No 11 which the Prime Minister is using."

While we were warning you, President Trump minimized the threat and failed to act promptly. As a result of his inaction, we will now experience a deeper recession (see why hell is coming).
In these volatile markets we scrutinize hedge fund filings to get a reading on which direction each stock might be going. Keeping this in mind, let's take a look at whether Spire Inc. (NYSE:SR) is a good investment right now. We check hedge fund and billionaire investor sentiment before delving into hours of research. Hedge funds spend millions of dollars on Ivy League graduates, unconventional data sources, expert networks, and get tips from investment bankers and industry insiders. Sure they sometimes fail miserably, but their consensus stock picks historically outperformed the market after adjusting for known risk factors.
Is Spire Inc. (NYSE:SR) a healthy stock for your portfolio? Prominent investors are getting less optimistic. The number of bullish hedge fund positions retreated by 2 recently. Our calculations also showed that SR isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q4 rankings and see the video at the end of this article for Q3 rankings).
So, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the SP 500 ETFs by more than 41 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter. Even if you aren't comfortable with shorting stocks, you should at least avoid initiating long positions in stocks that are in our short portfolio.

We leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example, we believe electric vehicles and energy storage are set to become giant markets, and we want to take advantage of the declining lithium prices amid the COVID-19 pandemic. So we are checking out investment opportunities like this one. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. Our best call in 2020 was shorting the market when SP 500 was trading at 3150 after realizing the coronavirus pandemic's significance before most investors. With all of this in mind let's take a look at the new hedge fund action regarding Spire Inc. (NYSE:SR).
How have hedgies been trading Spire Inc. (NYSE:SR)?
Heading into the first quarter of 2020, a total of 12 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock, a change of -14% from the previous quarter. The graph below displays the number of hedge funds with bullish position in SR over the last 18 quarters. With hedgies' capital changing hands, there exists an ""upper tier"" of noteworthy hedge fund managers who were upping their holdings significantly (or already accumulated large positions).

Among these funds, Renaissance Technologies held the most valuable stake in Spire Inc. (NYSE:SR), which was worth $47.4 million at the end of the third quarter. On the second spot was AQR Capital Management which amassed $2.4 million worth of shares. Citadel Investment Group, AlphaCrest Capital Management, and Laurion Capital Management were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Quantinno Capital allocated the biggest weight to Spire Inc. (NYSE:SR), around 0.26% of its 13F portfolio. Sciencast Management is also relatively very bullish on the stock, designating 0.1 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to SR.
Due to the fact that Spire Inc. (NYSE:SR) has witnessed a decline in interest from hedge fund managers, logic holds that there exists a select few hedgies who sold off their entire stakes heading into Q4. Interestingly, Israel Englander's Millennium Management dumped the largest position of the 750 funds tracked by Insider Monkey, valued at an estimated $2.4 million in stock, and Donald Sussman's Paloma Partners was right behind this move, as the fund dropped about $0.9 million worth. These moves are intriguing to say the least, as aggregate hedge fund interest dropped by 2 funds heading into Q4.
Let's now take a look at hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to Spire Inc. (NYSE:SR). We will take a look at The Timken Company (NYSE:TKR), Glacier Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:GBCI), Rayonier Inc. (NYSE:RYN), and Tripadvisor Inc (NASDAQ:TRIP). All of these stocks' market caps are closest to SR's market cap.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 26.5 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $403 million. That figure was $55 million in SR's case. The Timken Company (NYSE:TKR) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Glacier Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:GBCI) is the least popular one with only 13 bullish hedge fund positions. Compared to these stocks Spire Inc. (NYSE:SR) is even less popular than GBCI. Our calculations showed that top 20 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 41.3% in 2019 and outperformed the SP 500 ETF (SPY) by 10.1 percentage points. These stocks lost 17.4% in 2020 through March 25th but managed to beat the market by 5.5 percentage points. A small number of hedge funds were also right about betting on SR, though not to the same extent, as the stock returned -17.7% during the same time period and outperformed the market as well.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The coronavirus-driven global shift to working from home is set to have boosted demand for Samsung Electronics' memory chips from laptop makers and data centres, but first-quarter profits are likely to remain flat as the outbreak weakened consumer electronics sales.
The South Korean tech giant is the world's largest memory chip maker, and its Galaxy smartphones are a major rival of Apple Inc's products.
Samsung, which also makes home appliances and displays, on Tuesday releases guidance for the January-March quarter profit which is widely expected to be unchanged, and come under pressure in the next few quarters as the impact of coronavirus-related factory and retail stores shutdowns bites.
""The visibility for Samsung's earnings is low for the second quarter,"" said Lee Do-hoon, an analyst at CIMB Research.
For the quarter which just ended, Samsung is likely to estimate its operating profit at 6.2 trillion won ($5.05 billion), unchanged from the same period a year ago, according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate, weighted towards more consistently accurate analysts.
However, the company already warned last month that the pandemic would hurt sales of smartphones and consumer electronics goods this year, and analysts said a prolonged virus outbreak could put higher demand for memory chips at risk.
""If COVID-19 continues into 2H20, the memory market outlook could change for the worse,"" CW Chung, head of research at Nomura in Korea, said in a recent report.
When the outbreak first started in China last year, Samsung's strategy of spreading out its production base to countries including Vietnam and India seemed to pay off: rivals such as Apple were hit by supply disruptions as China shut down factories and locked down cities to control the coronavirus.
Apple rescinded its profit forecast earlier this year due to production halts and retail store shutdowns in China.
But as the virus spread across the globe, Samsung too has had to close factories and retail stores in Europe, India and the United States, further unnerving investors: Samsung Electronics shares have slumped 15% so far this year, but outperformed the wider market's 22% fall.
Prospects for Samsung's flagship Galaxy S20 premium smartphones, launched more than one month ago, look dim. Its 5G-enabled S20 phones are already selling at a third of their launch price of $1,308 in South Korea, an official at a local carrier told Reuters.
Brokerage Hanwha Investment  Securities estimates Samsung smartphone sales fell 17% in the first quarter from a year earlier. Last year, a slump in profits at the smartphone and chip businesses more than halved Samsung's full-year earnings.
Its display business, which counts Apple and China's Huawei Technologies as customers, is likely to have swung back to a loss after three consecutive quarterly profit due to sluggish demand from its clients, analysts said.
Samsung only provides its estimates for its first-quarter revenue and operating profit on Tuesday, with details likely to be released later this month.

(NASDAQ:GBCI) is a good investment right now. We like to check what the smart money thinks first before doing extensive research on a given stock. Although there have been several high profile failed hedge fund picks, the consensus picks among hedge fund investors have historically outperformed the market after adjusting for known risk attributes. It's not surprising given that hedge funds have access to better information and more resources to predict the winners in the stock market.
Is Glacier Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:GBCI) ready to rally soon? Investors who are in the know are taking a pessimistic view. The number of bullish hedge fund bets were trimmed by 1 in recent months. Our calculations also showed that GBCI isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q4 rankings and see the video at the end of this article for Q3 rankings). GBCI was in 13 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. There were 14 hedge funds in our database with GBCI holdings at the end of the previous quarter.
In the financial world there are a large number of tools investors have at their disposal to grade stocks. A pair of the most under-the-radar tools are hedge fund and insider trading indicators. We have shown that, historically, those who follow the top picks of the best fund managers can outperform the broader indices by a solid amount. Insider Monkey's monthly stock picks returned 72.9% since March 2017 and outperformed the SP 500 ETFs by more than 41 percentage points. Our short strategy outperformed the SP 500 short ETFs by 20 percentage points annually (see the details here). That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is a useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

Skylands Capital is also relatively very bullish on the stock, earmarking 0.14 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to GBCI.
Due to the fact that Glacier Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:GBCI) has experienced falling interest from hedge fund managers, it's easy to see that there were a few funds who were dropping their entire stakes by the end of the third quarter. At the top of the heap, D. E. Shaw's D E Shaw dropped the biggest investment of all the hedgies followed by Insider Monkey, comprising an estimated $0.3 million in stock, and Steve Cohen's Point72 Asset Management was right behind this move, as the fund dumped about $0.1 million worth. These transactions are important to note, as total hedge fund interest fell by 1 funds by the end of the third quarter.
Let's check out hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to Glacier Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:GBCI). These stocks are Rayonier Inc. (NYSE:RYN), Tripadvisor Inc (NASDAQ:TRIP), Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ:BHF), and Echostar Corporation (NASDAQ:SATS). All of these stocks' market caps match GBCI's market cap.

After several tireless days we have finished crunching the numbers from nearly 835 13F filings issued by the elite hedge funds and other investment firms that we track at Insider Monkey, which disclosed those firms' equity portfolios as of December 31st. The results of that effort will be put on display in this article, as we share valuable insight into the smart money sentiment towards Echostar Corporation (NASDAQ:SATS).
Echostar Corporation (NASDAQ:SATS) was in 26 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. SATS has experienced a decrease in hedge fund sentiment recently. There were 32 hedge funds in our database with SATS positions at the end of the previous quarter.

Now we're going to take a look at the fresh hedge fund action surrounding Echostar Corporation (NASDAQ:SATS).
What does smart money think about Echostar Corporation (NASDAQ:SATS)?
Heading into the first quarter of 2020, a total of 26 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on this stock, a change of -19% from the previous quarter. Below, you can check out the change in hedge fund sentiment towards SATS over the last 18 quarters. With hedgies' sentiment swirling, there exists a select group of noteworthy hedge fund managers who were adding to their stakes substantially (or already accumulated large positions).

Among these funds, Renaissance Technologies held the most valuable stake in Echostar Corporation (NASDAQ:SATS), which was worth $169.4 million at the end of the third quarter. On the second spot was Hound Partners which amassed $145.2 million worth of shares. Mangrove Partners, Park West Asset Management, and Greenlight Capital were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Hound Partners allocated the biggest weight to Echostar Corporation (NASDAQ:SATS), around 10.07% of its 13F portfolio. Mangrove Partners is also relatively very bullish on the stock, setting aside 9.67 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to SATS.
Because Echostar Corporation (NASDAQ:SATS) has witnessed a decline in interest from the aggregate hedge fund industry, we can see that there were a few funds that decided to sell off their entire stakes last quarter. It's worth mentioning that Derek C. Schrier's Indaba Capital Management dumped the largest stake of the ""upper crust"" of funds followed by Insider Monkey, comprising an estimated $17.1 million in stock. Ken Griffin's fund, Citadel Investment Group, also said goodbye to its stock, about $4.5 million worth. These transactions are interesting, as aggregate hedge fund interest was cut by 6 funds last quarter.
Let's also examine hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Echostar Corporation (NASDAQ:SATS) but similarly valued. These stocks are CoreSite Realty Corp (NYSE:COR), NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO), Transocean Ltd (NYSE:RIG), and Cabot Microelectronics Corporation (NASDAQ:CCMP).

644	Yahoo	1872220	Debasis Saha	Were Hedge Funds Right About Souring On Rayonier Inc. (RYN)?	"We hate to say this but, we told you so. On February 27th we published an article with the title Recession is Imminent: We Need A Travel Ban NOW and predicted a US recession when the SP 500 Index was trading at the 3150 level. We also told you to short the market and buy long-term Treasury bonds. Our article also called for a total international travel ban. While we were warning you, President Trump minimized the threat and failed to act promptly. As a result of his inaction, we will now experience a deeper recession (see why hell is coming).
In these volatile markets we scrutinize hedge fund filings to get a reading on which direction each stock might be going. Keeping this in mind, let's take a look at whether Rayonier Inc. (NYSE:RYN) is a good investment right now. We like to check what the smart money thinks first before doing extensive research on a given stock. Although there have been several high profile failed hedge fund picks, the consensus picks among hedge fund investors have historically outperformed the market after adjusting for known risk attributes. It's not surprising given that hedge funds have access to better information and more resources to predict the winners in the stock market.
Is Rayonier Inc. (NYSE:RYN) going to take off soon? Investors who are in the know are turning less bullish. The number of bullish hedge fund positions fell by 1 recently. Our calculations also showed that RYN isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q4 rankings and see the video at the end of this article for Q3 rankings).
Why do we pay any attention at all to hedge fund sentiment? Our research has shown that a select group of hedge fund holdings outperformed the SP 500 ETFs by more than 41 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that'll significantly underperform the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 35.3% through March 3rd. That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

We leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example, we believe electric vehicles and energy storage are set to become giant markets, and we want to take advantage of the declining lithium prices amid the COVID-19 pandemic. So we are checking out investment opportunities like this one. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. Our best call in 2020 was shorting the market when SP 500 was trading at 3150 after realizing the coronavirus pandemic's significance before most investors. With all of this in mind we're going to analyze the latest hedge fund action encompassing Rayonier Inc. (NYSE:RYN).
Hedge fund activity in Rayonier Inc. (NYSE:RYN)

The largest stake in Rayonier Inc. (NYSE:RYN) was held by Impax Asset Management, which reported holding $143.8 million worth of stock at the end of September. It was followed by Renaissance Technologies with a $136 million position. Other investors bullish on the company included Third Avenue Management, Millennium Management, and Driehaus Capital. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Third Avenue Management allocated the biggest weight to Rayonier Inc. (NYSE:RYN), around 4.16% of its 13F portfolio. Impax Asset Management is also relatively very bullish on the stock, setting aside 1.6 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to RYN.
Due to the fact that Rayonier Inc. (NYSE:RYN) has witnessed bearish sentiment from the aggregate hedge fund industry, logic holds that there exists a select few funds that elected to cut their full holdings last quarter. At the top of the heap, Greg Poole's Echo Street Capital Management sold off the largest position of all the hedgies monitored by Insider Monkey, worth an estimated $10.7 million in stock. D. E. Shaw's fund, D E Shaw, also cut its stock, about $1.3 million worth. These moves are interesting, as total hedge fund interest dropped by 1 funds last quarter.
Let's now take a look at hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to Rayonier Inc. (NYSE:RYN). These stocks are Tripadvisor Inc (NASDAQ:TRIP), Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ:BHF), Echostar Corporation (NASDAQ:SATS), and CoreSite Realty Corp (NYSE:COR). This group of stocks' market valuations are closest to RYN's market valuation.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 32.25 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $575 million. That figure was $360 million in RYN's case. Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ:BHF) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand CoreSite Realty Corp (NYSE:COR) is the least popular one with only 21 bullish hedge fund positions. Compared to these stocks Rayonier Inc. (NYSE:RYN) is even less popular than COR. Hedge funds dodged a bullet by taking a bearish stance towards RYN. Our calculations showed that the top 20 most popular hedge fund stocks returned 41.3% in 2019 and outperformed the SP 500 ETF (SPY) by 10.1 percentage points. These stocks lost 17.4% in 2020 through March 25th but managed to beat the market by 5.5 percentage points. Unfortunately RYN wasn't nearly as popular as these 20 stocks (hedge fund sentiment was very bearish); RYN investors were disappointed as the stock returned -32.2% during the same time period and underperformed the market.

1478	Stuff	2432043	Jessica Chandra	Married at First Sight couple Jules Robinson and Cam Merchant are having a baby	"Jules Robinson and Cam Merchant have shared the exciting news that they're expecting their first child.

The couple — who met and fell in love on Married At First Sight Australia 2019, and legally married in a ceremony in November — revealed their baby joy in the new issue of Stellar.

Jules, 37, admitted she was surprised to fall pregnant as easily as she did given her age.

""I honestly thought it was going to come with a fight. Because of my age, I had done all the hormone testing, the egg count... so much is instilled that you're going to struggle because of your age,"" she said.

But she believes that focusing on her other baby, her shapewear line Figur, may have helped because it kept her mind on something else. ""I wasn't obsessing over it. And for that, I'm so grateful.""

Jules learned she was pregnant when she took a test after feeling ""so sick"". The pregnancy test originally showed up as negative, but over time the two lines appeared and the couple realised they were going to be parents.

They found out on the weekend that Jules shot the campaign for Figur, so it was an especially busy time.

""Of course, it didn't change the weekend, but there was a lot of champagne going around and cheers-ing, so I just had to go under the radar,"" she recalled. ""It got to Sunday and I said to Cam, 'I need to go to the doctor'. Because I felt all the signs, I needed to know if this was really happening.""

When Cam, 36, found out he was going to be a father, he admitted he was emotional and cried, adding, ""It's a big step and I've never done this before"".

But kids have always been on the cards for Jules and Cam, who discussed early in the experiment — on their honeymoon, in fact — the prospect of raising a family together. Jules was nervous about raising the topic of children so soon into their marriage, but she didn't need to worry — Cam was right on board and eased her worries.

Jules and Cam won't find out the baby's gender and will spend a majority of Jules' pregnancy in isolation due to the coronavirus crisis. But they're taking it in their stride and even joked that it took them back to their MAFS days.

""We joke that we feel we're back in the experiment of MAFS again. Spending 24/7 with your partner is not natural for anyone, but we've done it once, so we can do it again,"" said Jules.

As for cravings? Jules revealed, ""Honey on toast and Weet-Bix. I hadn't bought Weet-Bix in 20 years!""

1478	Stuff	955543	Rob Stock	Forex broker warned over lax anti-money laundering systems	"In an electronic age, the fight against money laundering invovles making banks, and other financial companies responsible for checking who they are taking on as clients.

An online foreign exchange and options broker has been formally warned for its lax anti-money laundering processes.

The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) issued a formal warning to NZX-accredited broker Tiger Brokers (NZ) Limited for failing to have several adequate anti-money laundering protections in place.

It was one of seven businesses reprimanded for their anti-money laundering practices, the FMA said.

Anti-money laundering laws are designed to make it difficult for terrorists and criminals to move money around.

The FMA is responsible for monitoring around 800 businesses for anti-money laundering processes under the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Act.

The FMA said Tiger Brokers had failed to properly identify clients, including checking relevant customer identification documents.

It had also failed to check where clients' wealth came from, or as it put it failed to ""obtain adequate source of fund or wealth information relating to high risk customers, and take reasonable steps to verify that information"".

And, it had failed to take reasonable steps to determine whether a customer or any beneficial owner, was a ""politically exposed person"".

Tiger Brokers had also failed to report suspicious activity to the relevant authorities within three working days after forming a suspicion.

The FMA concluded there were reasonable grounds to believe Tiger Brokers had contravened the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Act.

Tiger Brokers has been ordered to prepare and submit a plan to the FMA before April 17 describing how and when it would address the issues.

""It must then complete these actions by 30 September 2020 or it will face enforcement action,"" said James Greig, head of supervision at the FMA.

""Warnings are an important regulatory tool for the FMA because they can force faster change than court proceedings. In these cases, formal warnings were the most proportionate response to the conduct by the firms in question.

""A public warning is designed to send a signal that we have issues with a company, and they need to address the concerns we have raised,"" he said.

""The severity of Tiger Brokers' likely breaches meant that a public warning was necessary, especially because it is a large business that is growing fast in New Zealand.

""The issues were wide ranging and weren't minor or technical, meaning there was potential for immediate and ongoing damage to the integrity of our financial markets.""

""The anti-money laundering legislation has been in effect for some time now, so we expect businesses to be aware of their obligations and why it is important to the integrity of New Zealand's financial system.""

""While the industry is grappling with the impacts of Covid-19, anti-money laundering is a high-risk issue so we are continuing to actively monitor for non-compliance and take enforcement action.

Greig said: ""We decided not to name the other six businesses after considering the proportionate regulatory response. All of these firms in breach were either small businesses or individuals, and they are cooperating with the FMA and taking steps to become compliant.""

""Many of the private warnings relate to independent audits of anti-money laundering systems. These audits are essential because they help to ensure businesses have robust systems and processes to detect and deter money laundering. A guidance document on the auditing of risk assessments was issued last year so there is now no excuse for non-compliance.""

The FMA conducts cyclical reviews of the roughly 800 entities it supervises for anti-money laundering. In 2019, the FMA analysed the AML audit reports of 49 businesses. The regulator also performs on-site monitoring visits.

He said the warnings, issued under section 80 of the AML/CFT Act, did not suggest the businesses had allowed or enabled illegal activity to take place."
78	The Los Angeles Times	1039122	Alex Wigglesworth	Coronavirus outbreak at Riverside nursing home leaves 30 sick	"Riverside County announced Sunday that 30 patients of a skilled nursing facility, Extended Care Hospital of Riverside, tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Some staff members also had tested positive, and officials were awaiting results from other patients and workers at the 90-plus-bed facility, public health officials said Sunday. The facility was closed to new admissions, sick patients were being isolated, and staff were not being permitted to work elsewhere. “This is a very serious situation and shows why we must all take serious steps to change our behavior, because these steps are intended to protect our most vulnerable,"" Riverside County Supervisor Karen Spiegel said in a statement. The county also said another person had died of the coronavirus and 134 had tested positive, bringing the county's death toll to 19 and its total number of cases to 799. Nursing homes and assisted-living centers across California continued to see significant increases in coronavirus cases, alarming officials who are trying to slow the spread. The older populations of these facilities almost always have underlying health problems, making them particularly vulnerable to the virus. They often live in close quarters. Administrators have responded by banning visitors, confining patients to their rooms and scrambling to create sterile wings to treat residents who contract the disease. Still, there have been outbreaks at facilities from Redondo Beach to Burlingame. Twenty-seven people at a skilled nursing facility in the East Bay city of Orinda have tested positive for the coronavirus."
1099	Irish Times	1032255	Paul Cullen	Ireland has struggled to protect nursing homes from Covid-19	"Ireland has got many things rights in tackling the coronavirus pandemic but the handling of nursing homes is not one of them.

In less than 10 days, the number of outbreaks in public and private nursing homes has gone from four to 50. That number jumped by 10 in a single day over the weekend, indicating we have some way to go before the disease is brought under control in this kind of residential setting.

This was not without warning. Concerns about the potentially devastating impact of a Covid-19 outbreak in a nursing home were already being flagged at the start of March, when just that had happened in Seattle in the US, leading to multiple deaths.

One of the first cases of the disease, again at the start of March, involved a GP in the west who had worked in a nursing home as well as other healthcare settings before he was diagnosed. It appears this case did not lead to an outbreak in the nursing home in question, but here was a pattern – of key workers moving around different healthcare settings – that perhaps should have been noted more.

Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI) responded to the growing crisis on March 4th by imposing nationwide visiting restrictions on private facilities.

On March 10th, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said the blanket restrictions should be lifted because they were premature and impacted on residents’ social interactions.

That stance seems extraordinary now, with the benefit of hindsight, but the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) was anxious not to impose restrictions too soon. Perhaps it, along with the rest of us back then, may not have seen things getting so bad so quickly.

Three days later, on March 13th, the visiting ban was imposed, or re-imposed, as part of a package of restrictive measures recommended by NPHET to Government.

It has been clear from the start of the year that Covid-19 affects the old, and the frail, disproportionately. Residents of nursing homes, and of other care centres, were always liable to be at greater risk of dying.

Yet despite a plethora of new guidelines being developed for the emerging situation, none was specific to the nursing home sector.

On March 25th, when there were only a handful of clusters of Covid-19 in homes, NHI complained that it had made numerous representations to Minister for Health Simon Harris and his officials, but no offer of a meeting had been forthcoming.

NHI appealed for “specific guidance” for what nursing homes should do in the crisis and predicted homes would experience severe staff shortages when staff were most needed.

Asked about the issue of guidance last Friday, Dr Holohan said there were “extensive arrangements” in place across the sector and infection control guidelines for healthcare settings “that should have been applied” in nursing homes.

But, he acknowledged, there is a “wide variation” in standards in nursing homes, which are monitored by the Health Information and Quality Authority. “Some have very high standards and continue to be very safe [while] other places are not quite of that standard. We have to raise the standard of the entire sector.”

It is understandable much of the focus in this epidemic has been on the potential devastation a surge of cases might wreak on hospitals and, in particular, intensive care units.

However, the problem with the one-size-fits-all approach, including the lack of specific guidance for nursing homes (and other care centres, and home care providers) is that it ignores the different environment and culture applying in these sectors.

Typically, staff are paid less and receive less training than their equivalents in hospitals. Staff in these Cinderella sectors are hard to come by and many supplied by locum agencies work across different locations. They may be renting accommodation, sometimes cramped, with other care staff working in other locations; more factors that help the virus spread.

The Government is now recommending the cocooning of all over-70s, who are being advised to remain at home. It is ironic, therefore, that a safe environment is not being offered to the most vulnerable of this age group who are residing in nursing homes where outbreaks have occurred.

It is welcome the problem has been recognised, even if belatedly. The package of measures agreed at the weekend should ensure the chains of transmission in nursing homes are broken. Key to this will be the implementation of proper infection control among staff; after all the residents themselves, who are unlikely to be hospitalised even if they fall ill, have few choices."
1099	Irish Times	1046443	Pat Leahy	Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to put pressure back on smaller parties	"Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will seek to put the focus back on the smaller parties this week, agreeing a statement of principles to guide any new government and seeking to engage with Labour, the Social Democrats and the Green Party about how a new administration could be formed.

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the Fianna Fáil leader Micheal Martin are likely to circulate the statement of principles to the smaller parties and seek to meet their leaders in a bid to find a way forward with them.

There is not expected to be any change in their unwillingness to talk to Sinn Féin about forming a government, which both parties ruled out during and since the general election.

There is some hope in both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that Labour could be persuaded to engage on government formation after the party elected Alan Kelly as its new leader on Friday.

Mr Kelly defeated Aodhán Ó Ríordáin by 1,047 votes to 868 in a postal ballot counted on Friday – a margin of 55 per cent to 45 per cent

Mr Kelly said on Twitter that it was his “greatest honour” to be elected the 13th leader of the Labour party.

But he gave little indication that he was ready to change the party’s decision not to enter government.

“As leader I will of course continue to engage with all parties but when it comes to forming a government we have been very clear since the general election, that it is up to other parties to take their responsibilities seriously and it is up to them to form a stable government,” he said in a statement.

However, with or without smaller party involvement, there is now an expectation in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil that a deal can be done in the coming weeks. A number of independent TDs have privately indicated their willingness to support a government, sources say, though they will require a variety of national and local concessions to ensure their support.

Mr Martin faces some disquiet in his own party over such a deal, though if – as expected – he secures first run in the taoiseach’s office for Fianna Fáil it will ease some of the objections.

On Sunday, Éamon Ó Cuív – long a contrary voice to Mr Martin’s leadership – questioned an “assumption in media reporting over the last few days that FF members will automatically endorse an agreement arrived at by leadership of FG and FF.

“From what I hear speaking to FF local reps & members across the country, this could be way off the mark,” Mr Ó Cuív said in a tweet.

“There is serious disquiet within the party about forming such a long-term coalition. FF is a membership-led party and it is the members, acting collectively, that are the ultimate authority within the party,” he said.

The question of membership approval – necessary under Fianna Fail’s rules for any participation in government – also raises the issue of how such approval might be obtained.

Under the Covid-19 lockdown, the normal course of action of holding a special ard fheis cannot happen. Senior party figures have considered how they might hold a postal ballot, if such were needed. However, as one admitted this weekend: “Nobody has any idea how it might work.”

The final results of the Seanad election confirmed that the two parties will have a majority in the upper house if they form a government.

Fianna Fáil won 16 seats, while Fine Gael has 12, down from 14 in the last Seanad. A Government requires a minimum of 31 for a majority in the 60-seat Upper House, but a new Taoiseach would have the right to nominate 11 senators directly, giving the two parties a comfortable majority."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Sunday expressed hope that the United States was seeing a “leveling-off” of the coronavirus crisis in some of the nation’s hot spots for the viral outbreak.  
New York, the hardest-hit state, reported on Sunday that for the first time in a week deaths had fallen slightly from the day before, but there were still nearly 600 new fatalities and more than 7,300 new cases.  
“Maybe that’s a good sign,” Trump told reporters, referring to the drop in fatalities.

As of April 2, around 25% of survey respondents from Middlesbrough said they are not staying indoors, followed by 18.2% in north Hertfordshire and 17.7% of people in Burnley, the Evergreen Health app found.

More than 26,700 Evergreen Health users responded to a survey on their behaviour during the pandemic to help the app build up a “heat map” of how well different parts of the UK are sticking to the rules.

The best at staying at home were the people of Ryedale, North Yorkshire, at 98.2%, those in Wandsworth in southwest London and Adur in West Sussex, both on 97.5%, followed by Richmond upon Thames and Powys at 97.1%.

The respondents were also asked about symptoms of Covid-19, such as whether they have a dry cough or a temperature and if they are self-isolating, and also when they recover.

The anonymised data is being shared with the NHS and data scientists at the universities of Liverpool and Manchester to help them analyse the progress of the pandemic.

The app’s developers said for an area of the country to appear on the map, it had to have enough people in the sample sizes for the percentages quoted to be statistically significant.

App users are also sent guidance to protect themselves during the crisis, with tailored advice from the NHS to those deemed to be at the greatest risk of complications from the virus.

The app was launched in 2015 in partnership with the NHS so users could have access to all their health records and input their own fitness and wellbeing data to have all the information in one place, and now has 750,000 users.

Dr Ian Hall, from the University of Manchester, said: “Respondents are supporting a better understanding of the local experience of Covid-19 disease through sharing their data, which will be incredibly useful to national and local planning.

“This is an exciting emerging data stream and I look forward to helping interpret the data, with colleagues in Manchester and Liverpool, as it provides situational awareness to users and policy makers alike.”

This weekend, several local councils made the decision to close parks and other public spaces when thousands of people turned out to enjoy the sunshine."

""If it does work it would be a shame if we didn't do it early ... again you have to go through the medical people, get the approval,"" Trump said at the Sunday White House Coronavirus Task Force press briefing.
The US president said medical professionals ""know the side effects but they also know the potential"" of these drugs.
 ""We hope it works,"" Trump said.
According to the Johns Hopkins University's Coronavirus Resource Center, there are over 335,500 confirmed coronavirus cases in the US, which is the largest number of COVID-19 cases of all countries. The United States has the third largest death toll from COVID-19 in the world (over 9,500 fatalities), it is surpassed only by Italy (over 15,880 deaths) and Spain (more than 12,600 deaths). The city of New York alone has registered over 2,250 deaths from COVID-19."

With the country, indeed the world, having come to a standstill thanks to Covid-19, Rout could not make the journey to Kendrapada at this critical time and had little choice but to watch his mother’s rituals online.“I got permission from the authorities to travel by a car from Bengaluru to my village but most of my relatives advised me to stay put,” Rout told TOI over the phone.The same was the case with the two sons of 62-year-old Alekha Chandra Swain of Gupti village under Rajnagar block, who died of a heart attack on Friday night. Both of Swain’s sons work in a plywood factory in Ernakulam district of Kerala and have been unable to visit their native village to light the funeral pyre. On Saturday, they witnessed the funeral on a video call. Similarly, when Sanatan Patra (80) of Lalitagiri village died of advanced age on Friday, his only son, Ashok, who works in a private company in Kolkata, failed to attend the last rites. This it to Patra’s 20-year-old grandson Priyabrata to light the pyre, while Ashok watched it on his mobile phone.Coronavirus has left families devastated even in places where it has not directly infected anyone. “The virus has wreaked havoc on us. Both my sons could not attend the funeral of their mother,” grieved Mahendra Basanti, husband of Pramila (49), an Asha worker of Balijhari village under Pattamundai block who died of a heart attack on Friday. Her sons, Diptiranjan and Radhakanta, are both stuck in Mumbai where they work in a factory. They, too, saw the proceedings on a video call.But some like Tapan Pradhan managed to bid their loved ones goodbye in person. Tapan’s mother Sujata Pradhan (64) of Badamarichipali village died on Thursday. He reached his village from New Delhi in a car to attend the funeral on Friday night. “I hired a taxi to attend the funeral of my mother after obtaining permission from the authorities in New Delhi. My family delayed the funeral for a day for me,” said Tapan, who works as plumber in the national capital.

To prevent the spread of Covid-19, shopkeepers have to lead from the front and insist that their customers obey the norms. Every shop should have circles with minimum 2-metre gap for customers to stand in queue,” Chaudhary said.

Later, I began singing during my friends’ wedding. After joining the police force in 2016, I used to sing during my spare time,” said Pushbaraj.The brainwave for the song, Pushbaraj said, was the persistent requests his colleagues and seniors in the police were making for people to stay indoors to contain the novel coronavirus. “Under the present circumstances, Section 144 is in force throughout the country. Even then, a lot of people can be found loitering outside their houses… My song was a means to request people to stay indoors,” he said.Pushbaraj had recorded the song and shared it with a head constable, who was impressed and in turn shared it with his seniors.

It looks like more and more we'll be using it for that,"" Trump told reporters at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House. ""The ship is ready and if we need it for the virus, we'll use it for that.""

The USNS Comfort, docked in New York City harbor, had originally been designated as a space for non-coronavirus patients to alleviate the pressure from New York hospitals.

New York City's hospitals have been overwhelmed with coronavirus cases and are struggling to respond to patients streaming in. A shortage of personal protective equipment has also placed medical workers at risk of contracting the virus.

The US coronavirus death toll is now more than triple that of the 9/11 attacks, with almost half of the known pandemic-related deaths in New York.

There are at least 331,151 cases of coronavirus in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University's latest tally of cases. At least 9,441 people have died in the nation from the virus. Governors step into national spotlight as they combat coronavirus Earlier Sunday, the US surgeon general said this week is going to be the ""hardest and the saddest"" for ""most Americans' lives,"" describing the upcoming period of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States as a ""Pearl Harbor moment"" and a ""9/11 moment.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will declare a state of emergency over the coronavirus as early as Tuesday and will likely announce his plans to do so on Monday, the Yomiuri newspaper reported.  
Under a law revised in March to cover the coronavirus, the prime minister can declare a state of emergency if the disease poses a “grave danger” to lives and if its rapid spread could have a huge impact on the economy. The virus has already increased Japan’s recession risk.  
The move would give governors in hard-hit regions added authority to ask people to stay home, cancel events, and close schools and other public facilities.

‘Before I begin I want to express our nation’s well wishes to Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he wages his own personal fight with the virus,’ Trump said

‘All Americans are praying for him. He’s a friend of mine. He’s a great gentleman and a great leader and he’s, as you know, he was brought to the hospital today, but I’m hopeful and sure that he’s going to be fine.’

The president’s comments come after Johnson was taken to an NHS hospital late Sunday in London due to ‘persistent coronavirus symptoms.’

Johnson will reportedly be staying at the hospital for ‘as long as needed.’

‘On the advice of his doctor, the Prime Minister has tonight been admitted to the hospital for tests,’ a Downing Street spokesperson said.

                    The only surviving copy is carefully preserved by the National Records of Scotland
                
            
            
        The Declaration of Arbroath is seen by many as one of the most famous documents in Scottish history.
It was written on 6 April 1320 but its words continue to inspire some in the Scottish independence movement, 700 years later.
Its broader message is a call for the right of Scots to rule themselves - but some claim its significance has been overstated and its purpose was simply to shore up the reign of King Robert the Bruce.
What was the Declaration of Arbroath?

            
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
            
                Image caption
                
                    It is thought the letter was written at Arbroath Abbey
                
            
            
        First of all it was not really a declaration and did not get that name until much later.
It was a private missive to Pope John, which was endorsed by 39 of the most-powerful Scottish barons and earls, who supported Bruce as king.
They were appealing for help to end the wars of independence with England which had been going on for decades. 
Bruce had struck a blow to settle Scotland's independence in 1314 at the Battle of Bannockburn but there was no truce between the two nations and the disputes raged.
What does it say?

        
      BBC

It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting, but for freedom, for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself.



The most often quoted line from the declaration, which was originally written in Latin, is a statement of Scottish independence.
""For, as long as 100 of us remain alive, never will we on any conditions be subjected to the lordship of the English,"" it says. 
""It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting, but for freedom, for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself.""
The only surviving copy is a fragile sheepskin parchment, carefully preserved by the National Records of Scotland. 
Dr Alice Blackwell, senior curator of medieval archaeology and history at the National Museums Scotland, says the letter starts out with the names of all the barons who support it.
The main text, which is only about 800 words, opens by asserting Scotland's long history as an independent kingdom and talks about the ""countless evils"" perpetrated by English kings and the heroics of Robert the Bruce.
""It ends really powerfully with a plea to the Pope,"" Dr Blackwell says. ""It essentially threatens the Pope and says that if he doesn't help intervene, blood will be on his hands."" 
Why write to the Pope?

            
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
            
                Image caption
                
                    Robert the Bruce was king of Scotland until his death in 1329
                
            
            
        The barons hoped the Pope, as the head of Western Christendom, could put pressure of King Edward II of England to achieve peace.
It was also a subtle diplomatic attempt to get the Pope, who had clashed with Robert Bruce on a number of issues, to recognise him as the legitimate king of Scotland.
Pope John was no friend of King Robert, a man who had murdered a rival claimant to the throne in a church and had ignored Papal decrees. In fact the Pope was seeking to enforce his excommunication.
The letter was an appeal from the nobles to lift the excommunication and recognise Robert I as the rightful king.
Was it forgotten for centuries?

                    The declaration still contains many of the wax seals of the barons who signed it
                
            
            
        The significance of the Declaration of Arbroath to Scottish history is much discussed and disputed.
Dr Alan Borthwick, National Record of Scotland's head of medieval and early modern records, says there is very little record of it in the sources from around the time it was written and the major historians of the 16th Century make no reference to it.
""It was only in the 1680s when the text was printed in Latin, and then it was it was later translated into English thereafter, that people began to think this was a really important document,"" he says.
Robert Crawford, professor of Modern Scottish Literature, at the University of St Andrews told BBC Radio's Freethinking that the declaration lay in Edinburgh Castle for several centuries.
""It was nibbled by rats. It was not translated into English until the late 17th Century. It is in one sense a very obscure piece of medieval letter-writing,"" he says. 
""In another sense, like all the classiest pieces of medieval sheepskin it has its own Wikipedia page and in our day it has become internationally known.""
Did it inspire the US Declaration of Independence?

                    Senator Trent Lott maintains that the Scottish document inspired the writers of the US Declaration of Independence
                
            
            
        
            
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
        The Scottish document pre-dates the United States revolution by about 450 years but some - such as former Senate majority leader Trent Lott - are convinced it inspired the American Declaration of Independence, despite a lack of historical evidence. 
The annual Tartan Day celebrations in America - founded by Senator Lott in 1998 - take place on 6 April because that is the anniversary of the Declaration of Arbroath. 
Mr Lott told BBC Scotland: ""I have no doubt they had read the declaration, some people say that there is no connection, but I say 'just read them and then tell me there is not a connection'. 
""There is too much of the same verbiage and the same passion and the same reasons for these declarations.""
Dr Borthwick says scholars still debate at great length whether there is any genuine connection between the Arbroath declaration and the American declaration.
He says the Arbroath document probably only began being called a declaration in the late 19th or early 20th Century, and then probably because of the US Declaration of Independence.
The right to topple kings

                    Tartan Day in New York mark the anniversary of the Declaration of Arbroath
                
            
            
        The Arbroath letter praises King Robert for setting the Scots free and accepts that he has the right to be king.
But it warns that if he should change course and seek to make Scotland subject to England then they would ""drive him out as our enemy"".
Dr Borthwick says the current thinking among scholars is that this does not necessarily refer to the overthrowing Robert Bruce but to any successor such as Edward Balliol, who was supported by Edward II.
He says: ""There are many documents from the medieval period which attempt to impose some form of restriction on monarchical powers but this is very unusual, if not unique, in saying the king could be deposed.
""There is quite a difference there and they have taken it quite a step further.""
Was the declaration successful?
Dr Borthwick says the declaration had a small degree of success at the time but did not achieve its full aim.
He says the response from the Pope still did not describe Bruce as king of Scotland but he did write to Edward II of England and there was a clear steer from the Pope that he wanted a truce to be made.
However, it was eight years before a peace treaty was agreed, just months before Bruce died. 
How is the anniversary being celebrated? 
There had been plans for an Arbroath 2020 festival and the document was to be put on public display for the first time in 15 years at National Museum of Scotland but both events have been shelved due to coronavirus. 
Many celebrations have been rescheduled for next year so that the Declaration's 701st birthday is likely to be the big one."

Genetic testing and in-vitro fertilization testing company Yikon Genomics — which does business under the name Yikon Global — and its CEO Brandon Richard Hensinger, were listed as defendants, according to the suit.

“In this public health emergency, consumers require and under California law are entitled to accurate, reliable, and truthful information about COVID-19, including its testing,” the suit states. “The health, and even the lives, of California consumers depend on it.”

The city is seeking a court order that directs the company to stop marketing and selling the test kits plus $2,500 in fines for each alleged violation.

To date, the Food and Drug Administration has not approved any coronavirus tests for at-home testing. The agency has warned consumers against at-home testing, the suit states.

186	Biz Journals	960070	Caroline Hudson	Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and other North Carolina bankers scramble with Paycheck Protection Program	"The federal government's Paycheck Protection Program launched Friday with local bankers scrambling to take applications as quickly as possible.


The program authorizes up to $349 billion in loans through the Small Business Administration as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act — or CARES Act — signed into law a week ago. It's designed to give small businesses quick funding to mostly cover payroll, but also rent and utilities, for eight weeks after a loan is made. The loan will be forgiven if businesses maintain employee pay, according to a PPP fact sheet. Loan payments will be deferred for six months. 


            
            
        But the SBA and U.S. Treasury didn't release final guidelines until Thursday evening – hours before the program was scheduled to go live. 


NewDominion Bank CEO Blaine Jackson was one of many bankers who stayed up late studying the guidelines as soon as they were released. Phone calls and emails started early Friday morning. Most his of schedule on Friday was booked with conference calls. 


Charlotte-based NewDominion is a subsidiary of Ohio-based Park National Corp. Jackson said the bank won't start processing the PPP loans until Monday at the earliest. It is, however, accepting applications in advance. 


That's the case for many banks across North Carolina, said Peter Gwaltney, CEO of the N.C. Bankers Association. The last-minute guidelines leave much unanswered as banks rush to set up internal processes. Some banks are still waiting on SBA credentials. That has to happen before lenders have access to the online program to process applications, he said.


""Bankers spent all night reading, working on their systems, preparing their people for the unprecedented demand for this,"" Gwaltney said.


The federal government designed the program to roll out first through the SBA's preferred lenders, Gwaltney said. There are approximately 1,700 preferred lenders, compared to roughly 5,100 total in the U.S., he noted. More banks, credit unions and some financial-technology companies will follow suit next week. Many banks are accepting loan applications even if they can't process them yet.


Stan Lamb, financial adviser at Pinnacle Financial Partners Inc. (NASDAQ: PNFP), said he hasn't seen anything like this in his 20-plus years in the business.


Setting up for the PPP process has been a top-down approach at Pinnacle. The director of Pinnacle's SBA group is working directly with the chief operating officer, Lamb said. Pinnacle is prioritizing coronavirus-related lending. Typical SBA real-estate loans take 30 to 45 days, he said, but officials have alleviated some of the red tape to get the PPP loans out as quickly as possible.


""You're trying to roll out a program at lightning speed,"" Lamb said. ""Everybody wants to get their piece of the pie ... of what's available for their business to help them through this because everybody's struggling. Everybody's hurting right now, and they want to get in as soon as it's available.""


Pinnacle was ready to accept applications on Friday morning. Spokesperson Joe Bass said the bank has seen a steady stream of applications coming in since Thursday night. 


The SBA approved Gov. Roy Cooper's disaster declaration request earlier this month, allowing North Carolina's small businesses to apply for low-interest economic injury disaster loans. Lamb believes the SBA created the PPP because its disaster loans are not necessarily built for nationwide crises. 


Jim Engel, CEO of Aquesta Financial Holdings Inc., based in Cornelius north of Charlotte, said the bank's loan volume is ""massive"" compared to a normal time. Aquesta had about 120 PPP loans in progress as of Friday afternoon. 


Engel enlisted some branch employees to help input data and trained non-lenders to answer questions about the SBA's application process. At first he was seeing loan demand mostly from restaurants and hotels. That has since expanded into multiple retail sectors, including medical offices, he said.


On Thursday, Engel expressed his concern about the PPP's chosen 0.5 percent interest rate. He was hoping to break even on borrowing costs – saying it was ""not going to be a big moneymaker."" The federal government has since hiked the interest rate to 1 percent. That decision came after many banks raised questions on the previous rate. 


Jackson declined to share details on NewDominion clients' interest thus far, but he expects ""a significant number"" to apply for PPP loans. 


For him, important questions remain: How will the loan be forgiven? How does the bank ensure the money is used for eligible purposes? Does the six-month deferral apply to principal and interest?


Questions may not be answered for days or weeks, however. It all depends on how quickly the federal government moves on clarifications and processing the first applications. The SBA was processing more than $1.8 billion in loans as of 2 p.m. Friday, mostly from community banks, according to a tweet from Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin. Some of the large banks had not yet submitted numbers, he wrote. 


Charlotte's Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) was the first big bank to launch its PPP loan portal on Friday morning. The system prioritizes BofA's 1 million borrowing customers, CEO Brian Moynihan said in a CNBC interview. He urged small businesses to go to their primary banks to keep the process running smoothly.


Wells Fargo  Co. (NYSE: WFC) is still working to launch its PPP portal. On Friday, the bank said it is ""working as quickly as possible"" and is encouraging customers to keep checking its website.


Gwaltney refers to the recent scramble as ""inside baseball.""


""Opening day is here. It's April 3 and this is the day America's small businesses were told they could go to their bank and get one of these loans. So, it's not ideal circumstances, but banks are having to exercise some faith,"" he said. ""We're just asking for patience."""

                    Families are having to adjust to spending much more time together
                
            
            
        We may never forget the coronavirus lockdown. But are we still going to be talking to each other at the end of it?
Because apart from worries about the virus, there are likely to be rising tensions in some families having to live on top of one another at home.
In ordinary times, couples spend on average two-and-a-half hours together each day, says researcher into relationships Prof Jacqui Gabb of the Open University.
But that was in the BC era (before coronavirus), and now we can spend 15 or 16 of our waking hours together. And throw into that combustible mix, children who are out of school.

        Is it going to leave us seething with irritability or bring us serenely closer than ever before?
""We've never lived through something like this,"" says Prof Gabb.
Most of the usual emotional pressure-cooker points - like being cooped up together at Christmas or going on a family holiday - have clearly defined exit points.

        But not with the coronavirus lockdown.
""There are no certainties any more,"" she says.
But there are all the ingredients for stress on relationships, she says. 
There are worries about jobs and money, not enough personal space, lack of childcare, not being able to do the things you enjoy, not seeing friends and the anxieties caused by the virus outbreak.
The parent
""I am a single parent who is a key worker. I can work from home but am finding it impossible with my six and 10-year-old at home. Work have said I can drop my hours, but will lose the pay which I can't afford. My son has immune difficulties so cannot send him to school and we live with my 84-year-old mother. Feel really stuck!"" Shelley-Ann on workingmums.co.uk
""Lack of freedoms will be felt differently,"" says Dr Caroline Schuster, a psychologist who has worked with families in Dorset and Wiltshire.
She says people might be feeling a ""lack of privacy, boredom and isolation, even in a family"".
""For all of us, kids included, there is a loss of the old way of life.""
Both experts say they expect an increase in domestic violence from the lockdown.
We've also entered a strange new digital existence, with many working and socialising online.
But Prof Gabb warns that self-broadcasting on social media during the lockdown can put even more psychological pressure on families. Particularly if the smugness levels get too high.
""Not everyone is at home in their giant kitchen. Other people are struggling to feed their kids and are going stir-crazy,"" she says.
The teenager
""My parents are so annoying. I'll come downstairs and say, 'Good morning', and they'll reply, 'Good AFTERNOON'. It's like, OK, I'm a bum, I get it."" From ""annoying parents"" on Twitter.
The story of the lockdown is being seen through the eyes of the haves, rather than the have-nots, says Prof Gabb.
""It's not as easy as just put on an exercise video and bond with each other,"" she says.
Her concerns are echoed by research from Save the Children, with the charity finding the biggest worries for parents in the lockdown are getting enough food, helping children with schoolwork and concerns about money.
Children are worried about someone in their family getting sick, food shortages and not seeing friends.

            
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
        
            
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
        The loss of control over much of our everyday lives is stoking the domestic tensions. For adults used to being independent ""it's quite infantilising"", says Prof Gabb.
""A sense of control is incredibly important for humans,"" says Dr Punit Shah, a psychologist at the University of Bath.

                    Family holidays might be tense but we know when they are going to end
                
            
            
        When we feel we have no control we feel stressed - and he says there are all kinds of ""coping mechanisms"" appearing.
People might take a sudden interest in exercise, or focus on cleaning their house or working on the garden, giving them a sense of control over something.
The head teacher
""It is absolutely not possible to facilitate distance-learning with a primary-aged child and work from home at the same time. The very idea is nonsense. If you're trying to do that, stop now. You can certainly have activities where your child learns, but your focus is your job, and survival. Stop trying to be superheroes."" Joseph Hellett to parents in Hastings.
But Dr Shah says we should be more upbeat about what might emerge from this enforced confinement - and to ""give ourselves more credit"" for how we're adapting.
There could be an ""identity shift"" within families, as parents and children get to know each other better, says the psychologist.
""We shouldn't assume it will be negative and problematic,"" he says.

        Dr Shah says we're still finding out during this experience what helps us feel better. 
It might be a case of fear and clothing in the lockdown. 
Because in his case, Dr Shah says he feels more comfortable wearing smart working clothes when he is working from home, even if it surprises everyone else on the video conference.
One of the most visible tactics for stress-busting seems to be the family pet. When you go outside everyone who isn't jogging seems to be walking a dog. 
""There are really positive benefits,"" says Prof Gabb. Pets are particularly important for people living on their own, a group she thinks are not being adequately acknowledged during the lockdown.

645	New Zealand Herald	945097	Newsfeeds@nzherald.co.nz	Covid-19 coronavirus: Boris Johnson to stay in hospital 'for as long as needed'	"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to spend the night in hospital after being admitted for precautionary coronavirus tests.
  He was taken in earlier in the evening local time, but he is still leading the Government response on Covid-19.
  Johnson is understood to be in a National Health Service hospital in London where he will stay for ""as long as needed"".
  Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is likely to chair the daily Covid-19 meeting tonight NZT for ministers and officials, which is usually led by the PM.
    
Keir Starmer, the newly elected leader of the Labour Party said: ""Wishing the Prime Minister well and a speedy recovery.""
  Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish First Minister said: ""Wishing the PM all the best and a speedy recovery.""
  And Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London, said: ""Sending my very best to the Prime Minister and wishing him a swift recovery.""
  GP Dr Sarah Jarvis told the BBC it is likely the Prime Minister has ""moderate"" symptoms of coronavirus.
  ""The majority of people who develop coronavirus will have mild symptoms - that's probably 80 per cent or so,"" she said. ""The older you become the more likely it is that you will become severely unwell with this.
  ""There is a severe stage, a moderate stage and a critical stage.""
   
Jarvis, who is not Johnson's doctor, added:
  ""Given he is staying in charge of the Government, that suggests to me that he probably has moderate disease but that, as a precaution, he is being taken in to check the oxygen levels in his blood, to do X-rays and probably scans of his chest.
   ""And to do blood tests to see for instance what his white cell counts look like and what his liver functions look like.""
  Jarvis said of Boris Johnson's hospital admission: ""The main focus is going to be on his lungs.
  ""The majority of people are going to progress to have inflammation of the lungs and that inflammation can result in damage to lung tissue, but also importantly can prevent oxygen being transferred into the blood stream.""
   
She said the tests themselves are very rapid.
  ""You can clamp a monitor on to somebody's finger and that will give you a test very quickly, in fact in general practice we have systems set up where people who have been discharged from hospital are having those tests delivered to them and they just pop the monitor on to their finger and literally within 30 seconds it will give a result.
  ""The X-ray will take a little longer and the scan will need to be assessed and looked at by a consultant - we are certainly talking a couple of hours I would say.""
  Dr Rupert Beale, Group Leader, Cell Biology of Infection Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute, said:
  ""Doctors will be monitoring important vital signs such as oxygen saturations. They will also check blood tests to see what the immune response to the virus looks like, and to assess liver and kidney function.
  ""They will perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) to check the heart. More sophisticated tests may include a CT scan of the chest to get an accurate picture of the lungs. They will consider the best way to deliver oxygen, and will also consider other treatments depending on test results.
  ""We are in a struggle between humanity and a deadly virus. Whatever your politics, we are all on the same side. I wish the Prime Minister a speedy recovery.""
   QA: BORIS JOHNSON IN HOSPITAL
  Why has Johnson been taken to hospital?
  The Prime Minister was transferred to hospital as a ""precautionary measure"" on the advice of his doctor, according to Number 10. Ten days after his positive test for Covid-19, Johnson is still suffering a high temperature.
  Who is leading the Government?
When the Prime Minister first announced that he was ill last week, it was said that the Dominic Raab, Foreign Secretary, would take over if Johnson became too sick to work. A spokesman insisted tonight that Johnson remains ""in charge of the Government"" despite his hospital admission.
  Has Johnson been working since his diagnosis?
Johnson has led several meetings via video conferencing since his diagnosis including the Cabinet. He has shared several video updates from his Number 11 flat and stepped outside to join the nationwide clap for NHS staff on Friday NZT.
  Has his pregnant fiancee been ill?
Carrie Symonds said she had been suffering Covid-19 symptoms, but is ""on the mend"". Symonds, 32, who is expecting the couple's first baby in the early northern summer, said she was not tested for the virus.
  Has anybody else in the Government been ill?
Matt Hancock, Health Secretary, is already back at work after having tested positive for the coronavirus. Scotland Secretary Alister Jack also developed telltale signs of the illness. Chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty self-quarantined after he noticed symptoms, and the Prime Minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, also self isolating."

People were asked about changes to their personal finances, the general economy and whether they feel now is the right time to make major purchases, during interviews between March 16 and 27.The results produced an overall negative score in the consumer confidence barometer from GfK of minus 34, indicating a sharp decline in confidence of 25 points from a score of minus nine in mid-March.Our Covid-19 flash report shows a dramatic result with consumer confidence falling off the cliff in the last two weeks of March.The 25-point tumble was the biggest fall in confidence since records started in January 1974.The overall score of minus 34 is approaching the depths of negativity recorded by the index during the 2008 economic downturn.Confidence decreased on all measures within the index.Joe Staton, GfKs client strategy director, said: Our Covid-19 flash report shows a dramatic result with consumer confidence falling off the cliff in the last two weeks of March.The last time we saw such a decline was during the 2008 economic downturn.Our falling confidence in our personal financial situation and the wider economy reflects the new concern for many across the UK.Despite record grocery sales, and recent peaks for purchases of freezers, TVs and home office equipment as people prepared for a long period in the home, the major purchase index is down 50 points, a stark picture for some parts of the retail industry in the short to medium term.More than 2,000 people aged 16 and over were surveyed.
1081	Irish Independent	1307786	By Vicky Shaw, Pa Personal Finance Correspondent	New overdraft rules in force but lenders adjust plans due to coronavirus	New overdraft rules come into force from Monday, which mean firms can only charge one single annual interest rate for both arranged and unarranged borrowing. The changes were announced by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) long before the coronavirus outbreak put many households finances under pressure.Many overdraft providers had pegged their new single overdraft rates at around 40% – which is around double the rate some borrowers had previously been paying to use their arranged overdraft.However, as part stop-gap measures to help cushion the financial impact of coronavirus, some providers are temporarily freezing rates at lower levels or rolling them back down to what they had been before they were increased.Many providers are also ramping up their zero-interest overdraft buffers, so borrowers may not pay anything in the short-term.For example, HSBC UK is temporarily halving its new 39.9% overdraft rate, taking it back down to 19.9%.From April 9 for a three-month period, HSBC UK will also automatically increase its temporary interest-free buffer for millions of Bank Account and Advance Account overdraft customers to £500.NatWest has frozen overdraft interest at current rates for personal customers for at least three months.The temporary relief available for overdraft customers affected by the coronavirus outbreak varies between providers.But the FCA proposed last week that a blanket zero-interest buffer of £500 should be introduced across providers, for up to three months, on peoples main accounts.The proposal is being consulted on – but if agreed it could be in place by Thursday April 9.In the meantime, the new industry rules coming into force from Monday aim to make overdraft pricing simpler and fairer, reducing the burden on some people who have previously been paying high charges.Firms will need to charge a simple annual interest rate – without additional fees and charges for using an overdraft.The new rules will particularly help people who have paid high charges in the past for going into an unarranged overdraft.The FCA previously found that unarranged overdraft fees are often 10 times as high as charges for payday loans and fall disproportionately on vulnerable consumers.The regulators calculations suggested the cost of borrowing £100 through an unarranged overdraft would fall from a typical £5 per day to under 10p per day.It also said in January that it expects firms to help people who borrow large amounts within their arranged overdraft, which could include reducing or waiving interest or agreeing a repayment programme.Gareth Shaw, head of money at Which?, said: These important changes will give consumers more clarity about their finances and should help them make informed spending decisions.It is right that banks are now working with the regulator to provide further help for customers who may need to use an overdraft facility to help manage their finances during the coronavirus outbreak.The FCA must keep a close eye on developments in this area, including competitive pricing, to ensure that its transformation of current account overdrafts delivers for customers.Here is a round-up of what major providers have already announced about their new overdraft rates and the measures put in place for giving temporary relief to borrowers affected by coronavirus:New rate: Nationwide introduced a 39.9% rate in November 2019.Overdraft relief: The Society will not charge overdraft interest from April 20 until July 1 for those financially impacted by coronavirus. Customers can request a fee-free overdraft interest holiday by completing an online form. Nationwide will email or text to acknowledge requests.New rate: The majority of customers will pay 39.9% (29.9% for Club Lloyds). As the group takes a risk-based approach to overdrafts, some customers will pay 49.9%.Overdraft relief: All customers will be able to have a £300 interest-free buffer from April 6 to July 6. As a result of this, Lloyds said all its overdraft customers would pay less from April 6. It said 90% of customers would have paid less for their overdraft even if the £300 buffer across its accounts was not introduced.New rate: A rate of 35% took effect on March 22.Overdraft relief: Barclays is waiving all overdraft interest from March 27 until the end of April 2020, meaning no charges for customers to use their agreed overdraft. Interest will automatically be removed.Barclays is reviewing measures after this date and will be communicating with customers shortly.New rate: HSBC imposed a new rate of 39.9% on March 14. But it is now temporarily reducing the rate charged above its interest-free buffer to 19.9%.Overdraft relief: Alongside the rate reduction, HSBC said from April 9, for a three-month period, it will increase the temporary interest-free buffer for millions of Bank Account and Advance Account overdraft customers from £300 to £500.New rate: A rate of 39.49% would have been introduced on April 1 for NatWest customers, and on March 30 for RBS and Ulster Bank customers. But customers will continue to pay their current rate of interest for at least three months, meaning a maximum of 19.89% across arranged and unarranged borrowing.Overdraft relief: As well as the rate freeze, the bank has also removed all other overdraft fees and charges, so all customers who use their overdraft for the three months from March 30 will pay less.New rate: Santander previously announced it will be 39.9% from April 6, however it plans to make a further statement in due course.Overdraft relief: Santander previously announced a £350 interest-free overdraft buffer for three months from April 6. This means it will automatically waive interest on up to £350 of any agreed overdraft limit.Santander said last week: We will be reviewing the FCA proposals as a matter of priority and will be announcing new measures to help our customers as soon as possible.New rate: A rate of 35.9% was due to come into force on April 4 – but this has been delayed until July 3.Overdraft relief: Customers with an existing arranged overdraft will have the interest waived on up to £500 of arranged overdraft use until July 3.New rate: TSB previously announced a rate of 39.9%.Overdraft relief: TSB has introduced measures including fees waivers or implementing an interest freeze on their overdraft.It is looking to make changes to align with FCAs guidance, effective by April 9.

The Biggest Uncertainty
 
I see that Tony Nitti has addressed PPP this morning with Paycheck Protection Plan Loans: Three Things The SBA And Banks Need To Agree On Now. Good stuff there. Check it out. I am going to focus on one of the three and also take a step back and look at a larger picture.
 
The language in the legislation that is now driving accountants crazy is this exclusion from defined “payroll costs”:
 
 
 (bb) taxes imposed or withheld under chapters 21, 22, or 24 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 during the covered period;
 
Chapter 24 is the biggest concern - Collection of Income Tax At Source on Wages.
 
A really on-the-ball CPA Daniel Baratz of the Zenith Group wrote me on March 29 (two days after the act passed)
 
“Based on my read of this, the Act excludes taxes assessed or withheld under Chapters 21, 22 and 24 of the Code. From what I can tell, this is FICA, Railroad and Withholding at the source. 
 
To me, this seems to indicate that the amount of “payroll costs” eligible to be the basis for calculating the loan amount is your gross payroll MINUS federal income tax withholding as well as both employee and employer shares of social security and Medicare. Maybe I am missing something but I am having a hard time not reading it this way and also a really hard time believing that this was congress’ intent. 
 
If I am reading it right, this would mean, in theory at least that if an employee has chosen to have 100% of their pay withheld for FIT, the employer could borrow nothing to keep paying that employee during this period. Similarly, their ability to have loan amounts forgiven would actually be partly determined by each employee’s W-4. I really hope I am reading this wrong or the regulatory interpretation can get around this – what do you think?”
 
Here is my lame response.
 
“That is interesting. I don't read it that way. I'll look again. It will be clear pretty quickly when people start applying.”
 
That was last Sunday. It was around Wednesday or Thursday, that most of the rest of the world was catching up with Daniel Baratz. The CPA I consult for who drops F-bombs like a B-17 drops 500-pounders was on me about it on Thursday.
 
Why Accountants Think It Cannot Be So
 
I just don’t think of withholding as a tax that the employer is paying. I think of it as money that no longer belongs to the employer and is held in trust to be paid over rather quickly. And for many if not most employers, it goes into the hands of a payroll company at the same time the net is paid. Given the nasty stuff that happens when you fail to pay withholding it is a reasonable view.
 
But remember Reilly’s First Law of Tax Planning: It is what it is. Deal with it. In this case what it is remains unclear.
 
More From Daniel Baratz
 
At any rate, yesterday I call Mr. Baratz to eat a little crow, congratulate him for being ahead of the curve and ask for any further comments. He was very gracious. Here is some of what he wrote back to me:
 
“The federal government has an existing definition for “payroll costs”. It is reported by every employer in America on quarterly payroll tax returns. Despite that, 
 
 
 Section 1102 of the CARES act creates its own original and unique definition of “payroll costs” that does not exist anywhere else in the known universe and actually has no bearing on the actual amount of dollars (cost) employers must expend to pay their payroll!  
 
  
 
The result in a practical sense is that based on the current definition, even if an employer maintains 100% of their workforce and pays them 100% of their existing wages, they will likely have only a portion of their loan forgiven even though they have complied with the stated intention of the program. What is even crazier is that the amount of the forgiveness will actually be driven by each individual employee’s withholding elections. So, an employer that has several employees who request more tax to be withheld from their pay because maybe they like to get a big refund is penalized and will have less of their loan forgiven than someone whose employees choose to have less withheld. There is no economic basis for this approach. I do not know for sure what Congress’ intent was with excluding certain employee-paid taxes from the definition of Payroll Costs but I surely hope this was not it.”
 
I still think you should probably still apply for the loan, but please put it in a separate account and wait for some clarity before you count on not having to pay it back.
 
Take A Step Back
 
Remember that the Paycheck Protection Plan is not the only tool that Congress has given us to help deal with the crisis. 
 
There is the Employee Retention Credit Tony Nitti explained it further here.
 
There is the Economic Injury Disaster Loan.
 
There is Pandemic Unemployment Assistance.
 
That is not all, but it’s a lot.
 
And then there are tools that were already in the tool-box, but kind of buried pretty deep. One of those is Code Section 139 - Disaster Relief Payments. John E. McGrady discusses that here.
 
Some Probably Bad Ideas You Should Consider Anyway
 
It has occurred to me that an alternative or supplement to PPP might be laying some people off and then helping them out with some deductible disaster relief payments. Maybe you just use PPP money for people that can keep doing something during the crisis. Of course that sort of course assumes you have some resources. 
 
 On the other hand, that $600 per week supplement to unemployment might be a better deal than you paying them money that you might have to pay back even if you don’t have something extra to throw in.
 
I would not recommend taking up to $100,000 out of retirement accounts that you can put back during the next three years, but perhaps when combined with the net operating loss carryback that might be what lets you pull through.
 
Start With A Blank Slate
 
Now, I just gave you two quite likely bad ideas, but there might be the germ of a good idea buried in there. This reminds me a little bit of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 which made my career, because I read a bit more than the average accountant in my firm who lived by oral tradition and following last year. All of a sudden everything they knew was wrong.
 
As you look at these programs and how they interact and what your particular situation is, try to clear your mind of preconceived notions. Don’t fixate on any one tool. PPP might be a great hammer, but maybe your problem is not a nail."
27	Reuters	1149086	Reuters Editorial	Timeline: Johnson's activities before his hospitalisation with coronavirus	"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital for tests on Sunday in what Downing Street said was a “precautionary step” because he was showing persistent symptoms of the coronavirus 10 days after testing positive for it.

Below is a timeline with what we know about his activities over those 10 days, when he was self-isolating but still leading Britain’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, including chairing daily virtual emergency meetings. 
March 27, Friday - Johnson said he had tested positive for the coronavirus and that he would self-isolate in Downing Street. Health Minister Matt Hancock also tested positive, while England’s top medical officer began self-isolating after developing symptoms. 
“I’ve developed mild symptoms of the coronavirus. That’s to say - a temperature and a persistent cough,” Johnson said in a video posted on Twitter. 
“Be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus.” 
Johnson spoke by phone to U.S. President Donald Trump, who wished him a speedy recovery. 
Johnson chaired a government meeting on the coronavirus on Friday morning via teleconference. Johnson had meals delivered to the door of an apartment at 11 Downing Street while in self-isolation. 
March 28, Saturday - It is announced that Johnson will write to every UK household urging people to stay at home to help contain the coronavirus. 
March 29, Sunday - Johnson posted a video of himself in a suit and tie, thanking people for staying at home as well as health workers, grocers and pharmacists. 
March 30, Monday - Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Johnson was “full of vigour” despite being self-isolated. Johnson’s spokesman said that Johnson was fully able to run Britain’s coronavirus response despite the positive test, and he continued to chair daily meetings. 
Johnson tweeted a picture of himself attending a meeting via video link. 
March 31, Tuesday - Johnson chaired Cabinet - the first all-digital meeting of a British PM’s top team of ministers - on video platform Zoom. 
April 1, Wednesday - Johnson posted a video message on Twitter, lamenting a rise in the number of coronavirus-related deaths in Britain. 
April 2, Thursday - In another video message, Johnson vowed to ramp up testing for the coronavirus. 
He also came out by himself onto the doorstep in Downing Street to applaud frontline medical workers as part of the “Clap For Carers” initiative. 
April 3, Friday - A weary-looking Johnson said he would remain in isolation as he continued to have mild symptoms of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, including a high temperature, a week after he tested positive for the virus. 
“Although I’m feeling better and I’ve done my seven days of isolation, alas I still have one of the symptoms, a minor symptom, I still have a temperature, so in accordance with government advice I must continue my self-isolation until that symptom itself goes,” Johnson said in a video message, wearing an open-necked shirt. 
April 4, Saturday - Johnson said in a tweet that he spoke to newly elected opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer and invited him and other party leaders to a briefing the following week on how to work together during the national emergency. 
April 5, Sunday - Downing Street announced in the evening that Johnson had been taken to hospital as a precautionary measure because of the persistent nature of his symptoms 10 days after he first tested positive.

202	The New York Times	1233496	Charles M	Opinion | Social Distancing Is a Privilege	"People like to say that the coronavirus is no respecter of race, class or country, that the disease Covid-19 is mindless and will infect anybody it can.
In theory, that is true. But, in practice, in the real world, this virus behaves like others, screeching like a heat-seeking missile toward the most vulnerable in society. And this happens not because it prefers them, but because they are more exposed, more fragile and more ill.
What the vulnerable portion of society looks like varies from country to country, but in America, that vulnerability is highly intersected with race and poverty.


Early evidence from cities and states already shows that black people are disproportionately affected by the virus in devastating ways. As ProPublica reported, in Milwaukee County, Wis., as of Friday morning, 81 percent of the deaths were black people. Black people make up only 26 percent of that county.


As for Chicago, WBEZ reported Sunday that “70 percent of Covid-19 deaths are black,” and pointed out about surrounding Cook County, “While black residents make up only 23 percent of the population in the county, they account for 58 percent of the Covid-19 deaths.”
The Detroit News reported last week, “At least 40 percent of those killed by the novel coronavirus in Michigan so far are black, a percentage that far exceeds the proportion of African-Americans in the Detroit region and state.”
If this pattern holds true across other states and cities, this virus could have a catastrophic impact on black people in this country.
And yet, we are still not seeing an abundance of news coverage or national governmental response that center on these racial disparities. Many states haven’t even released race-specific data on cases and deaths. The federal government hasn’t either.


Partly for this reason, we are left with deceptive and deadly misinformation. The perception that this is a jet-setters’ disease, or a spring breakers’ disease, or a “Chinese virus” as President Trump likes to say, must be laid to rest. The idea that this virus is an equal-opportunity killer must itself be killed.
And, we must dispense with the callous message that the best defense we have against the disease is something that each of us can control: We can all just stay home and keep social distance.
As a report last month by the Economic Policy Institute pointed out, “less than one in five black workers and roughly one in six Hispanic workers are able to work from home.”
As the report pointed out, “Only 9.2 percent of workers in the lowest quartile of the wage distribution can telework, compared with 61.5 percent of workers in the highest quartile.”
If you touch people for a living, in elder care or child care, if you cut or fix their hair, if you clean their spaces or cook their food, if you drive their cars or build their houses, you can’t do that from home.
Staying at home is a privilege. Social distancing is a privilege.
The people who can’t must make terrible choices: Stay home and risk starvation or go to work and risk contagion.
And, this isn’t just happening here, it is happening with poor people around the world, from New Delhi to New Mexico.


If they go to work, they must often use crowded mass transportation, because low-wage workers can’t necessarily afford to own a car or call a cab.
Such is the life of the working poor, or those slightly above poverty, but still struggling. Our entire discussion around this virus is stained with economic elitism. In social media commentary about images of packed buses and crowds of delivery workers outside restaurants, people chastise black and brown people for not always being inside, but many of those doing the chastising do so from comfortable homes with sufficient money and food.
People can’t empathize with what it truly means to be poor in this country, to live in a too-small space with too many people, to not have enough money to buy food for a long duration or anywhere to store it if they did. People don’t know what it’s like to live in a food desert where fresh fruit and vegetables are unavailable and nutrient-deficient junk food is cheap and exists in abundance.
People are quick to criticize these people for crowding into local fast food restaurants to grab something to eat. Not everyone can afford to order GrubHub or FreshDirect.
Furthermore, in a nation where too many black people have been made to feel that their lives are constantly under threat, the existence of yet another produces less of a panic. The ability to panic becomes a privilege existing among those who rarely have to do it.
I wholeheartedly encourage everyone who can to stay home, but I’m also aware enough to know that not everyone can or will, and that it is not simply a pathological disregard for the common good.
If you are sheltering in place in an ivory tower, or even a comfortable cul-de-sac or a smartly well-appointed apartment, and your greatest concern is boredom and leftover food, please stop scolding those scratching to survive.

Young people spend more time playing video games than the rest of the population (UKIE), which is why in-game messaging represents a creative, targeted, and immediate way to help reinforce the government’s Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives message, to gamers.


Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, said:



 It is absolutely vital that we all follow the simple government advice to stay at home, protect
the NHS and save lives. I’m delighted to see the UK’s brilliant video games industry stepping
up to strongly reinforce this message to gamers across the UK.



Support from UK video games companies to date include:


Activision Blizzard King are inserting ‘Stay At Home’ messaging in their network of mobile games, most notably Candy Crush Saga. The firm has also donated more than 230 ‘digital poster’ advertising spaces in London, where they would normally advertise their own products, to be used for crucial public health messaging.


‘Stay At Home’ posters are already being featured in Codemasters’ DiRT Rally 2.0, played by millions of unique users since its launch in February 2019, and the company is now looking at ways to roll out more essential health messages in games across Europe and the U.S. in the coming weeks.


Rebellion will be including ‘Stay At Home’ messaging on their games landing page launch sites (the landing page when you load up a game) for their games, with the capacity for these messages to link to relevant gov.uk pages where appropriate. As well as developing games, Rebellion also publish comic books and have also offered advertising in these.


Humam Sakhnini, President of King said:



 Everyone at Activision Blizzard, and the King team I lead, are delighted that we’re able to play a small part and help with the delivery of vital public health information. Through our millions of players we’re able to assist Public Health England and the NHS spread their life saving message: stay at home, protect our NHS, and save lives.



Jason Kingsley OBE, Co-founder and CEO of Rebellion:



 We’re delighted to be working with the DCMS on this excellent initiative. We know how fundamentally beneficial video games, like Sniper Elite and Strange Brigade, and comics, like 2000 AD, have been and will continue to be for many of us during this extraordinary time. It makes total sense for us to help promote important public health messaging while keeping those fans entertained in the safety of their homes.



Toby Evan-Jones, VP Business Development at Codemasters:



 At Codemasters we came to realise that technology within our games, which enables the remote updating of banners within the virtual environment, could be repurposed to assist with the Coronavirus communication effort. This week, through collaboration with Bidstack Group PLC (providers of the ad-replacement infrastructure), we began delivering a version of Public Health England’s ‘Stay Home Save Lives’ message into DiRT Rally 2.0. It’s
fantastic to see conversations already being sparked amongst our community.



Approximately 37 million people in the UK play games, and there are around 2,277 active video game companies in the UK. Any company wishing to support the fight against coronavirus through in-game messaging and other initiatives should contact DCMS on enquiries@culture.gov.uk.

2068	New York Post	2432022	Carl Campanile	Thousands of NY COVID patients are being treated with anti-malarial drug	"As many as 4,000 seriously ill coronavirus patients in New York are being treated with the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, state health officials say.

President Trump has touted hydroxychloroquine as a potential life-saver, although there is no widespread scientific evidence to date showing it helps battle COVID-19.

But Gov. Andrew Cuomo last month said healthcare providers in the state would be using the drug in combination with the antibiotic Zithromax, or azithromycin, for some last-ditch cases, based on potentially promising research.

“Time is of the essence,’’ said Albany University Public Health Dean David Holtgrave, who is on the state’s research team, in a statement.

A state Health Department official said the DOH has shipped doses of hydroxychloroquine to 56 hospitals across New York, distributing enough “to treat 4,000 patients to date.”

Patients have received doses as part of four- or 10-day regimens, officials said.

The University of Albany’s School of Public Health is observing the drug’s impact on the patients, and its preliminary study could come back in weeks instead of the usual months, officials said.

There are also clinical trials being conducted to see whether the drug can help block transmission.

NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a random trial with a $9.5 million grant from the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation.

“Currently, there is no proven way to prevent COVID-19 after being exposed,” said Anna Bershteyn, an assistant professor with the Department of Population Health at NYU Langone and the study’s co-principal investigator.

“If hydroxychloroquine provides protection, then it could be an essential tool for fighting this pandemic. If it doesn’t, then people should avoid unnecessary risks from taking the drug.”

The RX has long been used to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.

Its potential side effects include everything from fatal heart arrhythmia to vision loss, ear-ringing, vomiting, mood changes, skin rashes and hair loss.

Health officials are treading cautiously, saying they don’t anticipate hydroxychloroquine will be a “miracle drug” against the coronavirus — but the studies are worth the gamble.

In terms of the NYU clinical trial regarding prevention, researchers are enrolling 2,000 adult volunteers at six sites.

They are recruiting people who lack any COVID-19 symptoms but have been in close contact with others who have a confirmed or pending diagnosis.

On a random basis, the trial participants will receive either hydroxychloroquine or a placebo pill — vitamin C — every day for two weeks.

Each day during the 14-day period and then again on Day 28, the participants will swab their nasal passages and send the samples to researchers to detect potential COVID-19 infection.

“If everything goes as planned, the eight-week trial could provide answers by summer on whether a preventive dose of the drug is safe and effective,’’ NYU Langone said in a release.


“If so, the strategy could give health officials a much needed boost in slowing person-to-person transmission.”

The federal Food and Drug Administration granted emergency-use authorization to use hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients amid the pandemic.

There has been anecdotal evidence — including from China — that the drug help patients clear the virus sooner.

But Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health, asked recently whether the drug was considered a treatment for the novel coronavirus, said, “The answer is no … The evidence that you’re talking about … is anecdotal evidence.”

Meanwhile, Northwell Health facilities — including Lenox Hill, Long Island Jewish and Staten Island University hospitals — and Maimonides Medical Center are giving moderately to seriously ill coronavirus patients certain antiviral drugs such as Sarilumab, an IL-6 inhibitor, and Remdesivir, a drug that incorporates itself into the genome.

Northwell has recruited 143 patients for a Sarilumab trial.

Mount Sinai’s-Icahn School of Medicine also is one of 34 institutions nationwide participating in the National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project. The program seeks blood-plasma donations from recovered coronavirus patients that contain antibodies that can be used to fight the virus in seriously ill patients."

        Conservation experts say the coronavirus pandemic, which likely originated at a market selling wild animals in China, is a watershed moment for curbing the global wildlife trade, which can drive extinction and spread disease.
When Adam Peyman walked into a restaurant in Vietnam to order a meal he was shocked to find wild animals, including threatened species, on the menu, alongside traditional rice, noodles and seafood. Sting ray, porcupine, softshell turtle, wild pig and wild goat were all on offer. 
""It was a bit of a surprise to see these foods,"" says the wildlife manager for the animal welfare organisation, Humane Society International. ""But, these kinds of wild foods are considered something of a luxury."" 
Feasting on exotic game has become a sign of status and wealth in some Asian countries. The desire for wildlife as food or medicine drives a trade in wild animals, some procured illegally, creating a breeding ground for disease and the chance for viruses to leap to humans.

         ""The consumption of wild animals, especially wild mammals, which can carry diseases that can cross the species barrier, does pose a real threat to human health,"" says Mr Peyman. ""It's hard to tell whether these animals are taken from the wild legally or not, some of them could have been smuggled in and then sold on these wet markets, as they're called.""
Wet markets
Wet markets have become a familiar sight in many countries in Southeast Asia, particularly mainland China. Selling live fish, chickens and wildlife, as well as fresh fruit and vegetables, they get their name from the melting ice used to preserve goods, as well as to wash the floors clean of blood from butchered animals.

        Wet markets can be ""timebombs"" for epidemics, says Prof Andrew Cunningham, deputy director of science at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL). ""This sort of way that we treat... animals as if they're just our commodities for us to plunder - it comes back to bite us and it's no surprise.""
Leap to humans
The current coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed tens of thousands of lives, likely originated in the Wuhan seafood market. Despite its name, the market was selling a lot more than fish, including snakes, porcupine and deer, according to one report.
After an initial cluster of cases connected to the market, the virus began spreading dramatically inside China, before reaching much of the world. The origins of the novel virus are unknown, but it most likely emerged in a bat, then made the leap to humans via another wild animal host. 
Scientists have for decades been drawing attention to outbreaks of human diseases that have originated in animals, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) and Ebola. 
The message from the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society is clear: ban live animal markets that trade in wildlife, stop illegal trafficking and poaching of wild animals.
""Not only will this help prevent the spread of disease, it will address one of the major drivers of species extinction,"" says the society.

                    The Wildlife Conservation Society is calling for a ban on wildlife consumption
                
            
            
        In the wake of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China introduced a ban on all farming and consumption of live wildlife, which is expected to become law later this year. Thousands of wildlife farms raising animals such as porcupines, civets and turtles have been shut down. However, loopholes remain, such as the trade in wild animals for medicine, pets and scientific research. 
Then there is the traditional Chinese medicines industry, which also uses wildlife products. Only recently, the Chinese government appears to have approved the use of an injection - ironically as a coronavirus treatment - that contains bear bile. 
Campaigners worry these exemptions could pave way for illegal trade on wildlife meat, as it did in the past with, for instance, tiger and leopard body parts. So pangolin meat could still be available as the animal's scales can be used for medicine and its nails as ornaments.
All eyes, therefore, are on the soon-to-be amended wildlife protection law - whether and how it would address those loopholes.   
In neighbouring Vietnam, the government is rushing through legislation to clamp down on illegal wildlife trade at street markets and online.  But some say it won't be easy to change cultural attitudes or to enforce bans, when wet markets are part of the local culture, with the belief that the meat sold there is fresh and cheap. 
Supply and demand
Prof Dirk Pfeiffer of City University of Hong Kong says the real issue is demand. ""The people who are providing them, whether that's farmed wild animals or animals from the wild, that's an important source of income for them. Pushing it underground, that's not the solution, so it needs to be a phased process."" 
This isn't the first time a pandemic has put the spotlight on wildlife trade. The 2002 Sars outbreak, which started in China and claimed more than 700 lives, was linked to bats and mongoose-like civets, although the source was never confirmed.

        Prof Cunningham says if we're to stop another pandemic in the future, we must focus on causes as well as effects. At the root of the problem is the destruction of nature, bringing animals and humans into conflict.
""Even in protected forests, the forests are still there, but the wildlife's gone from within them because they have ended up in markets,"" he says. "".And it's easy to finger point, but it's not just happening in China, it's happening in many other countries and even in the western world. We like to have exotic pets and many of those are wild caught and we ought to be putting our own house in order too.""

On February 27th we published an article with the title Recession is Imminent: We Need A Travel Ban NOW. We predicted that a US recession is imminent and US stocks will go down by at least 20% in the next 3-6 months. We also told you to short the market ETFs and buy long-term bonds. Investors who agreed with us and replicated these trades are up double digits whereas the market is down double digits. Our article also called for a total international travel ban to prevent the spread of the coronavirus especially from Europe. We were one step ahead of the markets and the president (see why hell is coming).
In these volatile markets we scrutinize hedge fund filings to get a reading on which direction each stock might be going. Is Transocean Ltd (NYSE:RIG) a good place to invest some of your money right now? We can gain invaluable insight to help us answer that question by studying the investment trends of top investors, who employ world-class Ivy League graduates, who are given immense resources and industry contacts to put their financial expertise to work. The top picks of these firms have historically outperformed the market when we account for known risk factors, making them very valuable investment ideas.
Transocean Ltd (NYSE:RIG) was in 26 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. RIG investors should pay attention to a decrease in hedge fund interest lately. There were 39 hedge funds in our database with RIG holdings at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that RIG isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q4 rankings and see the video at the end of this article for Q3 rankings).
Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the SP 500 ETFs by 41 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter.

We leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example, we believe electric vehicles and energy storage are set to become giant markets, and we want to take advantage of the declining lithium prices amid the COVID-19 pandemic. So we are checking out investment opportunities like this one. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. Our best call in 2020 was shorting the market when SP 500 was trading at 3150 after realizing the coronavirus pandemic's significance before most investors. Keeping this in mind we're going to take a gander at the fresh hedge fund action regarding Transocean Ltd (NYSE:RIG).
How have hedgies been trading Transocean Ltd (NYSE:RIG)?
At Q4's end, a total of 26 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on this stock, a change of -33% from the previous quarter. On the other hand, there were a total of 33 hedge funds with a bullish position in RIG a year ago. With hedge funds' positions undergoing their usual ebb and flow, there exists a few notable hedge fund managers who were boosting their stakes significantly (or already accumulated large positions).
Is RIG A Good Stock To Buy?
More
Among these funds, Contrarius Investment Management held the most valuable stake in Transocean Ltd (NYSE:RIG), which was worth $179.7 million at the end of the third quarter. On the second spot was Platinum Asset Management which amassed $125.2 million worth of shares. Luminus Management, Citadel Investment Group, and Avenue Capital were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Avenue Capital allocated the biggest weight to Transocean Ltd (NYSE:RIG), around 17.55% of its 13F portfolio. Contrarius Investment Management is also relatively very bullish on the stock, designating 9.42 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to RIG.
Judging by the fact that Transocean Ltd (NYSE:RIG) has witnessed bearish sentiment from the aggregate hedge fund industry, logic holds that there exists a select few fund managers that slashed their full holdings in the third quarter. Interestingly, Lee Ainslie's Maverick Capital dropped the biggest investment of the ""upper crust"" of funds tracked by Insider Monkey, valued at about $4.4 million in stock, and D. E. Shaw's D E Shaw was right behind this move, as the fund said goodbye to about $3.4 million worth. These moves are interesting, as total hedge fund interest dropped by 13 funds in the third quarter.
Let's go over hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Transocean Ltd (NYSE:RIG) but similarly valued. We will take a look at Cabot Microelectronics Corporation (NASDAQ:CCMP), Stag Industrial Inc (NYSE:STAG), Lazard Ltd (NYSE:LAZ), and ALLETE Inc (NYSE:ALE). All of these stocks' market caps are closest to RIG's market cap.
[table] Ticker, No of HFs with positions, Total Value of HF Positions (x1000), Change in HF Position CCMP,24,382670,7 STAG,18,126164,-6 LAZ,14,701694,-1 ALE,25,252011,3 Average,20.25,365635,0.75 [/table]
View table here if you experience formatting issues.
As you can see these stocks had an average of 20.25 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $366 million. That figure was $616 million in RIG's case. ALLETE Inc (NYSE:ALE) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Lazard Ltd (NYSE:LAZ) is the least popular one with only 14 bullish hedge fund positions. Compared to these stocks Transocean Ltd (NYSE:RIG) is more popular among hedge funds. Our calculations showed that top 20 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 41.3% in 2019 and outperformed the SP 500 ETF (SPY) by 10.1 percentage points. These stocks lost 17.4% in 2020 through March 25th and still beat the market by 5.5 percentage points. Unfortunately RIG wasn't nearly as popular as these 20 stocks and hedge funds that were betting on RIG were disappointed as the stock returned -80.8% during the first two and a half months of 2020 (through March 25th) and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential, you should check out the top 20 most popular stocks among hedge funds as most of these stocks already outperformed the market in Q1.

In these volatile markets we scrutinize hedge fund filings to get a reading on which direction each stock might be going. How do you pick the next stock to invest in? One way would be to spend days of research browsing through thousands of publicly traded companies. However, an easier way is to look at the stocks that smart money investors are collectively bullish on. Hedge funds and other institutional investors usually invest large amounts of capital and have to conduct due diligence while choosing their next pick. They don't always get it right, but, on average, their stock picks historically generated strong returns after adjusting for known risk factors. With this in mind, let’s take a look at the recent hedge fund activity surrounding LogMeIn Inc (NASDAQ:LOGM).
LogMeIn Inc (NASDAQ:LOGM) was in 31 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of December. LOGM has experienced a decrease in enthusiasm from smart money recently. There were 32 hedge funds in our database with LOGM holdings at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that LOGM isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q4 rankings and see the video at the end of this article for Q3 rankings).
Why do we pay any attention at all to hedge fund sentiment? Our research has shown that a select group of hedge fund holdings outperformed the SP 500 ETFs by more than 41 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that'll significantly underperform the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 35.3% through March 3rd. That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

Is LOGM A Good Stock To Buy?
More
The largest stake in LogMeIn Inc (NASDAQ:LOGM) was held by Elliott Management, which reported holding $116.1 million worth of stock at the end of September. It was followed by Renaissance Technologies with a $58.1 million position. Other investors bullish on the company included Greenhouse Funds, Paradice Investment Management, and Melqart Asset Management. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Greenhouse Funds allocated the biggest weight to LogMeIn Inc (NASDAQ:LOGM), around 7.86% of its 13F portfolio. Harvey Partners is also relatively very bullish on the stock, setting aside 3.61 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to LOGM.
Because LogMeIn Inc (NASDAQ:LOGM) has experienced bearish sentiment from the aggregate hedge fund industry, it's easy to see that there lies a certain ""tier"" of hedge funds who sold off their full holdings in the third quarter. It's worth mentioning that John Overdeck and David Siegel's Two Sigma Advisors said goodbye to the biggest investment of all the hedgies monitored by Insider Monkey, comprising about $13.1 million in stock, and Jerome L. Simon's Lonestar Capital Management was right behind this move, as the fund cut about $7.1 million worth. These moves are interesting, as aggregate hedge fund interest was cut by 1 funds in the third quarter.
Let's now review hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to LogMeIn Inc (NASDAQ:LOGM). These stocks are FTI Consulting, Inc. (NYSE:FCN), Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:OLLI), Southwest Gas Corporation (NYSE:SWX), and Stifel Financial Corp. (NYSE:SF). This group of stocks' market valuations match LOGM's market valuation.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 21.75 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $171 million. That figure was $504 million in LOGM's case. Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:OLLI) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Stifel Financial Corp. (NYSE:SF) is the least popular one with only 15 bullish hedge fund positions. Compared to these stocks LogMeIn Inc (NASDAQ:LOGM) is more popular among hedge funds. Our calculations showed that top 20 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 41.3% in 2019 and outperformed the SP 500 ETF (SPY) by 10.1 percentage points. These stocks lost 17.4% in 2020 through March 25th but still managed to beat the market by 5.5 percentage points. Hedge funds were also right about betting on LOGM as the stock returned -5.8% so far in Q1 (through March 25th) and outperformed the market by an even larger margin. Hedge funds were clearly right about piling into this stock relative to other stocks with similar market capitalizations.

The SP 500 Index, which is one of the most used benchmarks for the U.S. market, has grown its annual earnings per share (not adjusted for inflation) by about 6.5% every year over the past five years.
As a result, the share price of the benchmark increased by 20.4% over the past five years (it closed at $2,488.65 on April 3) and gained more than 40% until the effects from the coronavirus epidemic started to impact the market.


Past performance is not a guarantee of future results, but it does suggest when a business has or doesn't have a good foundation on which to grow.
Thus, investors may want to consider Republic Services Inc. (NYSE:RSG), Clorox Co. (NYSE:CLX) and Chesapeake Utilities Corp. (NYSE:CPK), as these companies have five-year earnings per share without non-recurring items growth rate of more than 6.5%.
Republic Services
The Phoenix-based waste management company grew its trailing 12-month earnings per share without non-recurring items by a yearly average of 18.1% over the past five full fiscal years. The share price of $72.53 at close on Friday is a result of a nearly 90% rise over the past five years.
The stock has a market capitalization of $23.15 billion, a price-earnings ratio of 21.78 versus the industry median of 16.1 and a price-sales ratio of 2.26 versus the industry median of 1.01.
Wall Street recommends an overweight rating for this stock with an average price target of $92.50 per share. The overweight rating means that the stock is projected to outperform.
GuruFocus assigned a moderate rating of 4 out of 10 for the company's financial strength and a high rating of 8 out of 10 for its profitability.
Clorox
The Oakland, California-based manufacturer and marketer of household, personal and professional products grew its trailing 12-month earnings per share without NRI by an annual average of 8.5% over the past five years. The closing price of $177.54 on April 3 is a result of a 57.2% increase over the past five years.
The stock has a market capitalization of $22.21 billion, a price-earnings ratio of 27.87 versus the industry median of 16.6 and a price-sales ratio of 3.7 compared to the industry median of 0.74.
Wall Street issued a hold rating for the stock with an average price target of $170.92 per share.
GuruFocus assigned the company a moderate financial strength rating of 5 out of 10 and a high profitability rating of 8 out of 10.
Chesapeake Utilities
The Dover, Delaware-based utility company grew its trailing 12-month earnings per share without NRI by an annual average of 9% over the past five full fiscal years. On the tailwind of this, the share price ($78.75 at close on April 3) rose by about 53% over the past five years.
The stock has a market capitalization of $1.29 billion, a price-earnings ratio of 19.92 compared to the industry median of 14.55 and a price-sales ratio of 2.22 versus the industry median of 1.15.
Wall Street recommends an overweight rating for this stock with an average price target of $102 per share.
GuruFocus assigned a low score of 3 out of 10 to the company's financial strength, but a high score of 8 out of 10 to the company's profitability.

644	Yahoo	1872220	Debasis Saha	Here is What Hedge Funds Think About Stag Industrial Inc (STAG)	"We hate to say this but, we told you so. On February 27th we published an article with the title Recession is Imminent: We Need A Travel Ban NOW and predicted a US recession when the SP 500 Index was trading at the 3150 level. We also told you to short the market and buy long-term Treasury bonds. Our article also called for a total international travel ban. While we were warning you, President Trump minimized the threat and failed to act promptly. As a result of his inaction, we will now experience a deeper recession (see why hell is coming).
In these volatile markets we scrutinize hedge fund filings to get a reading on which direction each stock might be going. Hedge Funds and other institutional investors have just completed filing their 13Fs with the Securities and Exchange Commission, revealing their equity portfolios as of the end of June. At Insider Monkey, we follow nearly 835 active hedge funds and notable investors and by analyzing their 13F filings, we can determine the stocks that they are collectively bullish on. One of their picks is Stag Industrial Inc (NYSE:STAG), so let’s take a closer look at the sentiment that surrounds it in the current quarter.
Is Stag Industrial Inc (NYSE:STAG) a great investment today? The smart money is taking a bearish view. The number of long hedge fund positions retreated by 6 lately. Our calculations also showed that STAG isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q4 rankings and see the video at the end of this article for Q3 rankings).
Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Our research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the SP 500 ETFs by more than 41 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that'll significantly underperform the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 35.3% through March 3rd. That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

We leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example, we believe electric vehicles and energy storage are set to become giant markets, and we want to take advantage of the declining lithium prices amid the COVID-19 pandemic. So we are checking out investment opportunities like this one. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. Our best call in 2020 was shorting the market when SP 500 was trading at 3150 after realizing the coronavirus pandemic's significance before most investors. With all of this in mind we're going to check out the recent hedge fund action regarding Stag Industrial Inc (NYSE:STAG).
How are hedge funds trading Stag Industrial Inc (NYSE:STAG)?

Trailing Balyasny Asset Management was Millennium Management, which amassed a stake valued at $20.4 million.

Forward Management is also relatively very bullish on the stock, designating 1.01 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to STAG.
Due to the fact that Stag Industrial Inc (NYSE:STAG) has faced declining sentiment from the entirety of the hedge funds we track, logic holds that there were a few funds that slashed their positions entirely last quarter. Intriguingly, Stuart J. Zimmer's Zimmer Partners dropped the biggest investment of all the hedgies watched by Insider Monkey, valued at about $44.2 million in stock. Clint Carlson's fund, Carlson Capital, also said goodbye to its stock, about $43.7 million worth. These transactions are important to note, as total hedge fund interest fell by 6 funds last quarter.
Let's check out hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Stag Industrial Inc (NYSE:STAG) but similarly valued. These stocks are Lazard Ltd (NYSE:LAZ), ALLETE Inc (NYSE:ALE), Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (NYSE:AMG), and LogMeIn Inc (NASDAQ:LOGM). This group of stocks' market caps match STAG's market cap.

Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (NYSE:AMG) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Lazard Ltd (NYSE:LAZ) is the least popular one with only 14 bullish hedge fund positions. Stag Industrial Inc (NYSE:STAG) is not the least popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still below average. This is a slightly negative signal and we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. Our calculations showed that top 20 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 41.3% in 2019 and outperformed the SP 500 ETF (SPY) by 10.1 percentage points. These stocks lost 17.4% in 2020 through March 25th but beat the market by 5.5 percentage points. Unfortunately STAG wasn't nearly as popular as these 20 stocks (hedge fund sentiment was quite bearish); STAG investors were disappointed as the stock returned -33.9% during the same time period and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential, you should check out the top 20 most popular stocks among hedge funds as most of these stocks already outperformed the market in Q1.

In these volatile markets we scrutinize hedge fund filings to get a reading on which direction each stock might be going. The financial regulations require hedge funds and wealthy investors that exceeded the $100 million equity holdings threshold to file a report that shows their positions at the end of every quarter. Even though it isn't the intention, these filings to a certain extent level the playing field for ordinary investors. The latest round of 13F filings disclosed the funds' positions on December 31st. We at Insider Monkey have made an extensive database of more than 835 of those established hedge funds and famous value investors' filings. In this article, we analyze how these elite funds and prominent investors traded Lazard Ltd (NYSE:LAZ) based on those filings.
Lazard Ltd (NYSE:LAZ) was in 14 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. LAZ investors should pay attention to a decrease in activity from the world's largest hedge funds recently. There were 15 hedge funds in our database with LAZ positions at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that LAZ isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q4 rankings and see the video at the end of this article for Q3 rankings).
In today’s marketplace there are a lot of indicators stock market investors put to use to appraise publicly traded companies. A couple of the most innovative indicators are hedge fund and insider trading moves. We have shown that, historically, those who follow the best picks of the best hedge fund managers can trounce the SP 500 by a very impressive amount (see the details here).

Ariel Investments is also relatively very bullish on the stock, earmarking 2.73 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to LAZ.
Since Lazard Ltd (NYSE:LAZ) has experienced bearish sentiment from the aggregate hedge fund industry, it's safe to say that there was a specific group of money managers that decided to sell off their entire stakes last quarter. Interestingly, Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group sold off the largest position of all the hedgies followed by Insider Monkey, worth an estimated $2.4 million in stock. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke and John Campbell's fund, Arrowstreet Capital, also sold off its stock, about $1.8 million worth. These moves are interesting, as total hedge fund interest fell by 1 funds last quarter.
Let's now review hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Lazard Ltd (NYSE:LAZ) but similarly valued. These stocks are ALLETE Inc (NYSE:ALE), Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (NYSE:AMG), LogMeIn Inc (NASDAQ:LOGM), and FTI Consulting, Inc. (NYSE:FCN).

We like to analyze hedge fund sentiment before conducting days of in-depth research. We do so because hedge funds and other elite investors have numerous Ivy League graduates, expert network advisers, and supply chain tipsters working or consulting for them. There is not a shortage of news stories covering failed hedge fund investments and it is a fact that hedge funds' picks don't beat the market 100% of the time, but their consensus picks have historically done very well and have outperformed the market after adjusting for risk.
Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:OLLI) has experienced an increase in hedge fund interest in recent months. Our calculations also showed that OLLI isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q4 rankings and see the video at the end of this article for Q3 rankings).
Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the SP 500 ETFs by 41 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter.

  The company, which owns New World, Pak'n Save, Four Square and Raeward Fresh supermarkets, is trialling a virtual check-in for shoppers where they text the supermarket they want to shop in, and get alerted when it's their turn.
  The possible solution to shoppers' queuing woes is currently being trialled at New World Kumeu and Pak'nSave Royal Oak to ""overwhelmingly positive customer feedback"", 
Simon Kennedy, Foodstuffs North Island Chief Digital Officer, says.
  Customers are given two options to ""check-in"" at participating stores – virtually or physically. However, regardless of their choice, all customers check in at entry.

• Covid 19 coronavirus: Customer pressure easing, Foodstuffs says
• Covid 19 coronavirus: Foodstuffs to consult owners over Easter opening, says no price gouging
• Covid 19 coronavirus: Countdown returns supermarket specials, Foodstuffs increases staff pay

   Customers who virtually check in on their phones will receive a text when it's their turn to enter. Customers who physically check in with a team member at a desk will have their names put on a list, and their name will be called when it's their turn to enter.
  The solution is easy, free and all customers need is a mobile phone.
  The four step process will see a customer texting to ""check in"" to secure a place in line.
  They will then get a text reply confirming their place in the line, allowing them to wait somewhere else more comfortable, including their car.
  The customer will then receive another text when it's their turn to enter the store and shop.
  To get inside, the customer will show their text confirmation to the store check-in team to enter.
  Customers who don't have a mobile phone can check-in directly with store staff and still wait elsewhere, but will need to stay within earshot to hear their name called by store staff when it's their turn to enter.
   He likened the system to other virtual queues including requesting a call back when on hold with airline customer service, or putting your name in for a reservation at a restaurant and receiving a text when your table was ready.
  Kennedy said the initiative, if adopted, would save customers, especially the vulnerable or elderly, time by having to wait in line.
  ""New Zealanders are settling into a new normal and consolidating their shops into one big shop so they can stay home and stay safe.
    • Covid19.govt.nz: The Government's official Covid-19 advisory website
  ""When it's time to make a trip out for essentials, customers now have two check-in options at stores where we're trialling the solution. It's great for all customers, but particularly for those who are vulnerable or elderly who can now wait somewhere more comfortable.
  ""By reserving a virtual spot in line, they can now wait in their car or go for a walk around the block to get some fresh air.""
  He said the goal with virtual check-in, was to improve their customers' overall experience.
  ""The physical distancing measures we need to maintain inspired the teams to innovate a solution which would simplify store arrival and give customers the flexibility to wait where they please.""
  Store staff and signage would be available to advise customers which number they should text and to answer any questions they might have.
  The average virtual wait varied by how busy the store was and how many customers were allowed in the store based on the 2m physical distancing measure, he said. 
 
Further national roll out of the trial beyond New World Kumeu and Pak'nSave Royal Oak would be decided in due course, he said.
  The virtual queue solution was in collaboration with NextUp, a collective of people from New Zealand retail and technology companies who have come together to help create solutions to assist New Zealanders during this time."
27	Reuters	1149086	Reuters Editorial	McLaren boss Brown warns F1 must change to survive	"LONDON (Reuters) - Formula One is in “a very fragile state” due to the new coronavirus crisis and risks losing some of its 10 teams unless some big changes are made, McLaren boss Zak Brown warned on Sunday. 
FILE PHOTO: Formula One F1 - Russian Grand Prix - Sochi Autodrom, Sochi, Russia - September 28, 2019   McLaren Chief Executive Officer Zak Brown   REUTERS/Anton Vaganov


The season has yet to start, with two races — including the showcase Monaco Grand Prix in May — cancelled and six postponed so far. 
The sport has already made some changes, including postponing a planned major technical rule change from 2021 to 2022 and agreeing teams will use the same cars next year but Brown said more was needed. 
“Could I see — through what is going on right now in the world if we don’t tackle this situation head on very aggressively — two teams disappearing? Yeah,” the American told the BBC. 
“In fact, I could see four teams disappearing if this isn’t handled the right way.” 
Brown said the economic and health situation meant it should not be assumed anyone would be lining up to take over any struggling teams. 
“I don’t think the timing could be worse from that standpoint,” he added. “So I think F1 is in a very fragile state at the moment.” 
McLaren last week became the first team to put staff on furlough while ratings agency Moody’s changed Formula One’s outlook to negative from positive. 
Team bosses are due to discuss cost-saving plans on a call on Monday. 
A $150 million budget cap, still well above the spending levels of some smaller teams, is due to come into force next year but Brown indicated there was a push for it to be reduced further — possibly to $100 million. 
“You have everyone at $150m, and the strong majority — including one of the big teams — willing to come substantially under $150m,” he said. 
There is also some discussion about a further postponement of the technical rule changes to 2023.

27	Reuters	1259367	Alan Baldwin	Leclerc is also a winner for Ferrari on the virtual racetrack	"LONDON (Reuters) - Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc was a dominant winner on his Formula One esports debut on Sunday while World Cup-winning England cricketer Ben Stokes brought up the rear in a virtual Vietnam Grand Prix. 
FILE PHOTO: Formula One F1 - Australian Grand Prix - Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit, Melbourne, Australia - March 12, 2020   Ferrari's Charles Leclerc during the Media day     REUTERS/Edgar Su


The 28-lap race was the second in a series organised to provide some entertainment for fans starved of real-life action due to the new coronavirus pandemic that has stalled most sport worldwide. 
Sunday was originally scheduled to be the inaugural Vietnam  Grand Prix but the virtual race, with the 20 drivers joining remotely from their homes, was staged on a version of Melbourne’s Albert Park. 
The Hanoi street circuit is not yet available on the official F1 video game. 
“It was unbelievably hard,” said Leclerc, who led from start to finish and took the chequered flag 14.094 seconds clear of Danish Renault junior Christian Lundgaard with Williams F1 driver George Russell in third place. 
“We are sitting on a chair, so there is not even the G-force we have in a real car, but I am sweating like crazy,” added the Monegasque, winner of two races last year in his first season with Ferrari. 
“The muscles are not hurting but the concentration and everything, I’ve been sweating a lot.” 
Leclerc’s 19-year-old brother Arthur was fourth for Ferrari, just ahead of Italian Alfa Romeo driver Antonio Giovinazzi. 
Lundgaard would have started on pole but was given a five-place drop for exceeding track limits in qualifying. 
Jenson Button, the retired 2009 world champion, was 11th with McLaren team mate Lando Norris failing to start due to technical problems for the second race running and Mexican Esteban Gutierrez also absent. 
Norris’s Twitch streaming platform still had more than 77,000 viewers at its peak while more than 190,000 watched Formula One’s official livestream on YouTube. 
Stokes finished last, behind retired grand prix winner Johnny Herbert, but the all-rounder acquitted himself well in a field with six current F1 drivers and gave a cheerful thumbs up from his living room. 
China’s Guanyu Zhou, winner of the first race for Renault on a virtual Bahrain layout, did not compete. 
The next official virtual race is the Chinese Grand Prix on April 19. 
Formula One is hoping to resume racing for real with a reduced 15-18 round calendar from the European summer, subject to the spread of the virus.

1528	Hindu	942856	Special Correspondent	Coronavirus | CRPF DG, 14 senior officers test negative	"Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) Director General A.P Maheshwari and 14 senior officers who had gone into self-quarantine have tested negative for COVID-19.

They had gone into self quarantine a day ago after it was found that they came in indirect contact with the Chief Medical Officer of the CRPF who had tested positive for virus symptoms on April 2. The CMO reportedly contracted the virus at a transit guest house in Saket while he was on leave. It was this guest house that an officer who met Mr. Maheshwari had visited. The said officer, who was the primary contact, has also tested negative.

On Sunday, Mr. Maheshwari tweeted, “Intermediate and linked personnel including self have tested negative as per reports flowing today. However, further protocols will be followed as per medical advice.”

The CRPF is one of the largest central armed police forces (CAPF) deployed for internal security in the Maoist-affected areas, Jammu and Kashmir, northeast and other parts of the country.

He had earlier said as a precautionary measure he had restricted his movements as part of “responsibility to break the chain” adding that he was working from home till further clarity.

K. Vijay Kumar, Senior Security Advisor in the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) who had met Mr. Maheshwari, has also gone into quarantine.

Both the officers had met Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla at Mr. Shah’s residence on March 29 to hand over a cheque of ₹116 crore as a contribution from all paramilitary forces to the PM-CARES fund.

Mr. Shah has not gone into a quarantine and an officer clarified that the meeting took place much before."
1528	Hindu	946355	Staff Reporter	Coronavirus | Ganjam to penalise those without masks	"The Ganjam district administration in Odisha has said it will impose a penalty on those who are not covering their faces with masks while coming out when the lockdown is relaxed from 7 a.m. to noon.

Collector Vijay Amruta Kulange said violators in urban areas would be fined ₹1,000 and those in rural areas ₹500.

Those roaming the streets without any reason would be taken into custody and put under 14-day quarantine.

If anyone has to come out of homes during lockout relaxation period, he or she will have to cover their nose and mouth with a mask, handkerchief, scarf or any other cloth covering.

Ganjam is the first district in Odisha to make covering of faces compulsory with penalty on violators, as part of COVID-19 fight.

Ganjam district administration has also become strict on people, who roam unnecessarily during the lockdown relaxation period from 7AM to 12noon. As per order of Ganjam district administration, such irresponsible persons roaming without any reason will be taken into custody and put under 14 days quarantine. It was also found that large numbers of people including senior citizens were coming out for long morning walks during lockout relaxation time.

On Sunday, 18 persons were arrested and 307 vehicles were seized in Berhampur city of Ganjam district for violating the lockdown norms.

Till now no COVID-19 case has been identified in Ganjam, the most populous district in Odisha. But threat of the killer disease looms in this district as thousands of migrant workers have returned back to their homes in Ganjam district from outside the State and other parts of Odisha.

On Sunday, Ganjam district administration declared Matia Sahi village under Golanthara police station limits as COVID-19 hotspot and sealed it off. This village now has 130 migrant labourers, who have returned back from COVID-19 hotspots in Bhubaneswar. All movements of people and vehicles in and out of Matia Sahi has been restricted till further orders. Any person violating lockdown of this village will be taken to compulsory quarantine centre on campus of nearby National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST). Inhabitants of this village are being checked up by a medical team, while home delivery of all essential commodities to them is being ensured.

Ganjam district administration has also imposed complete shutdown throughout the district for 19 hours from 12noon till 7AM on the next day."
644	Yahoo	1128492	Naomi Nix	No Probe on Trump’s Early Virus Response, House Democrat Says	"(Bloomberg) -- House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn said it’s unlikely a congressional panel overseeing coronavirus relief will investigate the Trump administration’s initial response to the pandemic that’s claimed thousands of American lives.
“This committee will be forward-looking,” Clyburn told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” “We’re not going to be looking back on what the president may or may not have done back before this crisis hit. The crisis is with us.”
The South Carolina lawmaker said the panel will instead be looking at how $2 trillion stimulus package to address the economic fallout of the spread of Covid-19 is administered.
“The American people are now out of work, millions of them out of work,” he said. “The question is whether or not the money that’s appropriated will go to support them and their families, or whether or not this money will end up in the pockets of a few profiteers.”
Clyburn’s remarks arrive as some Democratic governors criticize the Trump administration for what they say is a failure to provide adequate supplies or centralized policies to the states to address the crisis, despite having weeks or months of lead time.
Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said during a Sunday news conference that the federal government knew about the seriousness of the virus as early as January but failed to act quickly enough.
“The idea that the United States federal government did nearly nothing for quite a long time is now being visited upon us,” Pritzker said. “If action had been taken earlier a lot fewer lives would be lost.”

1099	Irish Times	983835	Jade Wilson	Coronavirus: Social distancing on display at Dublin beach as people ‘get the message’	"On a bright Sunday afternoon on a near-empty beach in Sutton, north Dublin, Marie Clarke and her sister-in-law Lorraine Clarke say they feel as though they’re living in a “twilight zone” as they take their daily walk.

“It feels so strange . . . on a sunny spring day, in normal times, this beach would be packed,” Marie said.

Lorraine has observed that “there is social distancing, and people are afraid to be close to one another, especially the older people”. Despite this, Marie feels people are “more friendly” now.

“I’ve walked along here several times before and people wouldn’t bat an eyelid or say hello. But now people are smiling, saying: ‘Hello, lovely day, isn’t it?’ – it’s definitely loneliness. People are stuck inside all the time. Now, people want to say hello and just make some type of connection with human beings,” she said.

Emmet McCabe, who lives less than a kilometre away from the beach, which lies near Howth village, agrees that people are “getting the message now about social distancing” to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.

“I’m glad the beach is quite empty today. Before Leo [Varadkar] made the announcement about the tighter restrictions, I came down here and the beach was busier than it would be in the summer with people trying to find things to do. But it seems to be getting through to people now,” he said.

“I’ve seen a maximum of 20 people here along the whole beach and everyone is sticking to the groups they live with and giving others space. It took some time initially but now people are just getting on with it.”

He feels “lucky” to have a garden and to live near the beach. “I don’t know what it’d be like for people living in apartments or in town. I’m definitely running a lot more now than I was before because it is getting mundane, working from home as well. I play hurling a lot so it’s good to have a bit of competition between the lads, to beat each other’s times,” he said.

Niamh Kenny and her son Liam, who walk on the beach almost every day with their dog Alfie, have noticed more families visiting the beach with their kids as of late, but “people are being really good and keeping far apart.

“I think we’re even imagining 2m to be more than what it actually is . . . Everyone is going on the side of caution,” Ms Kenny said.

A local woman (84), who did not wish to be identified as she was “well above cocooning age”, sat on the beach alone.

“I’m well accustomed to being alone. I live alone and most of my children live abroad. But I’m very fit for my age – I played tennis into my 50s. I just have to get out for my daily walk to be able to cope,” she said.

The pattern was similar around the country, as gardaí reported high levels of compliance with the coronavirus guidelines.

High visibility patrols were mounted at several popular outdoor locations to remind people of the social distancing protocols. One of the Garda helicopters was deployed over Dublin, including over the Phoenix Park, for much of the weekend, to watch for large congregations of people.

In the Wicklow mountains, several hillwalkers exercising more than 2km from their homes were told to return home.

Deputy Commissioner John Twomey said: “We want to thank people for the high level of compliance with the health guidelines. It is vital that continues . . . for the rest of the time they are due to be in place. By working together and keeping to the HSE advice [on coronavirus], we can flatten the curve and save lives.”

This week Minister for Health Simon Harris is expected to sign new regulations granting additional powers to gardaí to enforce restrictions on movement. Those breaching the restrictions could face a fine of up to €2,500 and up to six months in prison."
2163	Investing	941339	Reuters	Japan PM Abe to declare state of emergency as early as Tuesday: Yomiuri	"© Reuters. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wears a protective face mask as he attends an upper house parliamentary session
        
    
    

         TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will declare a state of emergency over the coronavirus as early as Tuesday and will likely announce his plans to do so on Monday, the Yomiuri newspaper reported. 
 Under a law revised in March to cover the coronavirus, the prime minister can declare a state of emergency if the disease poses a ""grave danger"" to lives and if its rapid spread could have a huge impact on the economy. The virus has already increased Japan's recession risk. 
 
The move would give governors in hard-hit regions added authority to ask people to stay home, cancel events, and close schools and other public facilities."

55	Daily Mail UK	1038234	Rachel Mcgrath	Lee Fierro, famous for role in Jaws, dies at 91 from coronavirus	"Lee Fierro, who had a memorable role in Jaws, has died from complications of coronavirus.

She was 91 and passed away at an assisted living facility in Ohio, according to Variety.

Fierro appeared in the Steven Spielberg blockbuster as the mother of a young boy Alex Kintner who is the second victim of the Great White lurking in the waters off Amity Island.

In a memorable scene in the 1975 movie, after her son is killed, she walked up to police chief Brody, played by Roy Scheider, and slaps him across the face.

Longtime friend Nicki Galland told the Martha's Vineyard Times: 'She was tickled by it. She found it really entertaining.'

'She would say, ‘If you told me that’s what I’d be known for, I wouldn’t believe it.’'

Jaws was based on the novel by Peter Benchley and starred Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw.

Fierro reprised the role of Mrs. Kintner in 1987's Jaws: The Revenge.

She was a longtime resident of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, where much of Jaws was filmed.

She worked as a drama teacher at the Island Theatre Workshop at the time Jaws was made and went on to serve for 25 years as the workshop's artistic director.

She moved to Ohio in 2017 to be closer to her family, it's reported.

A memorial is planned to take place in Martha's Vineyard at a future date."
55	Daily Mail UK	950622	Cassie Carpenter	Lady Gaga debuts cyber punk, apocalyptic Chromatica album art	"Oscar-winning songwriter Lady Gaga unveiled her cyber punk, apocalyptic Chromatica album art to her captive, combined 196.2M Little Monster fanbase on social media on Sunday.

Photographer Norbert Schoerner captured the 34-year-old pink-haired pop diva pinned down by her metal logo against a grate backlit with pink in a fashion shoot directed by Nicola Formichetti.

In it, Mother Monster wears a bodice, arm leg brace, and right shoe by designer Cecilio Castrillo; a left 'Howlin Wolf' shoe by Gasoline Glamour; and articulated fingers by Gary Fay selected by stylist Marta Del Rio.

Gaga (born Stefani Germanotta) also debuted the vinyl and cassette cover art featuring her look from the February 27th music video for Stupid Love, the first of 16 tracks off her sixth studio album.

The nine-time Grammy winner postponed the April 10th release of Chromatica on March 24 as well as the fifth leg (April 30-May 11) of her 48-date Enigma concert residency in Las Vegas due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Stupid Love was produced by BloodPop and Tchami, but other tracks are rumored to have been conceived by Scottish DJ Sophie, German DJ Boys Noize, as well as her Joanne producer Mark Ronson.

However, Gaga did not postpone her six-city Chromatica Ball world tour, which is still scheduled to kick off July 24 at France's Stade de France in Saint-Denis.

Last Wednesday, the Joe Biden supporter teased a 'big announcement' regarding the COVID-19 crisis, which she 'promised' to announce on Monday's episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.

And on Thursday, the Shallow hitmaker donated to America's Food Fund, a new initiative supporting Feeding America and World Central Kitchen 'to feed those in need and impacted by' the fast-spreading virus.

Gaga is likely eager to save face after her father Joe Germanotta's 'embarrassing' public plea on March 27 for $50K in GoFundMe donations to the staff of his Manhattan restaurant Joanne Trattoria.

'She had no idea he was doing that and that idea would have been shot down before he even finished bringing it up — and the worst part is, it's her birthday!' a source told Page Six on March 30. 'Neither she nor [mother] Cynthia would ever let that happen. It was him acting on his own, unfortunately, really bad impulse.'"

Neither of the two workers had been at the Evergreen Park store for at least a week, Walmart said in a statement on Sunday. It's unclear how long either of the employees had the virus. It's also unclear whether COVID-19 was contracted on the job.

The victims were Wando Evans, 51, and Phillip Thomas, 48, Patch.com reported. Both had underlying health conditions, medical examiners told the online publication. The CDC says symptoms typically occur between two days and two weeks after exposure.

Watch out! Scammers are creating Netflix lookalikes to target people staying at home, study finds

""We are heartbroken to learn of the passing of two associates at our Evergreen Park store, and we are mourning along with their families,"" Walmart said in a statement to USA TODAY.

The store in question passed a third-party safety and environmental compliance test as well as a health department inspection within the past week, according to the company.

Attention workers:Can your boss make you come to work during coronavirus outbreak?

The discount retailer also said it was changing the way it approaches sanitation following the deaths, including hiring a third-party company to clean and sanitize high-touch surfaces at the store.

Walmart recently began limiting the number of shoppers allowed in its stores in a push to promote social distancing. Starting Saturday, Walmart stores will ""allow no more than five customers for each 1,000 square feet at a given time, roughly 20% of a store’s capacity,"" the retailer announced Friday.

After a store reaches its capacity, shoppers will be admitted inside on a 1-out-1-in structure."
55	Daily Mail UK	1807995	Jayne Fryer	Britain's tallest folly could be yours for a knockdown price of £1.6m	"Do you have lofty aspirations? Or perhaps you're nurturing a Rapunzel complex — perfect for these self-isolating times.

Or maybe just the thought of owning your very own Grade I-listed, 175ft, eight-storey tower, complete with 400 stairs, a basement media room that once doubled as a sex dungeon, communal ornamental pond, metre-thick walls, a crenellated coffee terrace and sweeping views over pretty much the whole of Kent are enough to put a spring in your step.

If so, read on.

Because there is a silver lining to the upheavals of recent times — for buyers, if not sellers. Property prices are being slashed and, suddenly, properties that most of us could only dream about are now far more affordable.

(If only we were able to move.) One of these — after a huge £400,000 price drop — is Hadlow Tower, the tallest folly in the country (soaring even higher than Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square), which dominates the village of Hadlow near Tonbridge, Kent, and could now be yours for £1.6 million.

For the price of a bog-standard terrace house in Fulham, London, you could live an entirely new life.

Each morning you'd wake in your four-poster bed to the sound of nesting peregrines, take your morning cuppa to the viewing platform on the eighth floor, run up and down the two staircases for exercise — or take the lift, if you're feeling lazy — gaze down on the peasants of Hadlow from your mullioned windows and, well, generally, behave as if to the manor born.

As current owner Christian Tym puts it: 'You can see it from about two miles away and whenever you even approach it, it puts a smile on your face. I don't think I've ever looked at it and not felt lucky to own it.'

Perhaps, like Christian and his wife Rebecca, both 43, you'll host endless murder mystery parties, snap up your very own suit of armour online and dream of designing your own crest — 'I would like one, but my wife said it was pretentious!'

Next you could pin up some family portraits and study your brand-new 'ancestral' home's history to wow your friends.

Hadlow Tower has certainly had its fair share of excitement.

Built in 1838 and originally attached to Hadlow Castle, it was the brainchild of Walter Barton May, a wealthy merchant who, legend has it, used it to spy on his errant wife as she canoodled with a farmer.

During World War II it was used as a lookout post. While the castle was torn down in 1951, the tower remained, but fell into disrepair before being rescued by artist Bernard Hailstone.

Over the next few decades, arty owners came and went. But its raciest years came during its 26-year ownership by a flamboyant hotelier who used it as a venue for sex parties.

What is now Christian's sleek media room and wine storage area was a sex dungeon, the bed in the Rapunzel room was awash with cavorting couples and the spiral stairs were crammed with bare bottoms and leather whips as people rushed up and down to join in the fun.

'The poor local residents weren't very happy to be woken up by leather-clad people asking where the sex party was,' says Christian.

Sadly, some of them also weren't very pleased either, when, in 2017, Christian snapped it up from the receivers for £425,000.

'I got a very good price.' he says.

'The place was amazing, Gorgeous, the craftsmanship, the finish, the very modern fittings!' His timing was immaculate.

The hotelier had been forced to sell, and between 1997 and 2012 the tower had been given £3.25million in grants to repair and restore it.

And, driven by the very passionate local Save Hadlow Tower Action Group, it had been sold for £1 to the Vivat Trust — a charity that preserved historic buildings — and transformed from storm-damaged wreck to a gleaming, beaming, beacon of extravagance again, and perfect as an eccentric holiday rental for about £1,900 a week.

But then Vivat went bust and Christian spotted an opportunity.

Cannily, he also secured planning permission to change its use from holiday let to private residence and in 2017 he, photographer wife Rebecca and their four sons, now six, eight, 11 and 12, moved in.

'The boys love the idea of living in a castle. That's the main reason why we bought it,' he says. 'But perhaps we did so with heart over head.'

Indeed within a year, and after having made only cosmetic changes to the decor, it was back on the market.

'We realised it didn't suit our needs quite as well as we'd hoped,' says Christian. Two of their four boys are deaf, and, while most people might welcome the muffling effect of three-foot-thick castle walls, they're not helpful to the hard of hearing.

Sadly, despite a flurry of interest, it didn't sell. Perhaps all the stairs were a turn-off. And there are also a couple of teeny snags for any owner to negotiate — two covenants that still today have more than two years to run.

To ensure your new home is well maintained at all times and — rather more onerous — to open it up to the public 28 days a year, if required.

'It's surprisingly flexible . You could just do the whole of January if you like,' insists Christian. 'People book ahead online but we don't get much interest.'

Last year he held just three open days.

Meanwhile, a friend of Christian's suggested raffling it.

'It wasn't a bad idea,' he says. 'We thought we could make a bit of money for deaf charities, too.'

So in 2018, he started selling raffle tickets for £4.50 each with the idea that, when he hit a certain amount, he'd draw a winner.

If the members of the action group were cross about him snapping up the tower for a song and trying to sell it on for £2 million, they were apoplectic at the indignity of a raffle.

Even Andre Lloyd Webber waded in at the time, saying: 'I don't think the public purse should be used to speculate.'

'We never really understood why they were all so against it,' says Christian. 'It wasn't us who received the grants. That was way before our time.'

In the event, the raffle didn't go to plan, either. Ticket sales were disappointing.

Eventually a cash prize of an undisclosed sum went to the winner. So the Tyms carried on living there, admiring the views, the peregrines and the craftsmanship and throwing murder mystery parties.

Until a couple of weeks ago, when it went back on the market again, this time at a discounted price.

'We're trying to be realistic — we've had Brexit and now this awful Covid thing,' says Christian. 'Of course we'll all shed a tear when we leave.'

So here, dear reader, is your chance — if you have a spare £1.6million to hand — to move up in the world in every possible way."

2339	ComicBook	952670	Jenna Anderson	10 Indie to Catch Up on During Coronavirus Self-Quarantine	"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a particularly profound impact on the comic industry, as publishers and fans try to adjust to a ""new normal"" in terms of distribution and release. A majority of new comics are on hold for the immediate future, leaving some to check out digital comics and collected editions of series to pass the time. While there are thousands of comics to check out on services like DC Universe and Marvel Unlimited (with Marvel recently uploading some significant free titles to that latter app), that's only the tip of the iceberg in terms of comics fans can explore. There are plenty of titles - either from other publishers or self-published entirely - that are just a few clicks away.

Many of these titles are available through Comixology (if you're wanting to lend a few bucks to the industry), as well as free services through your local library, such as Hoopla. Other titles are available entirely for free, partially because they got their start as webcomics. So, if you're looking for a good jumping-off point of indie comics to dive into while you're stuck at home, read on to find out our suggestions.




Check, Please!

(Photo: Check Please!)Available on: Official website

If you've been on Tumblr for the past eight-or-so years, you've probably heard something about Check, Please!. The series follows Eric ""Bitty"" Bittle, a former figure skater who joins his college's hockey team as a freshman. Through a series of ""vlogs"" set in real-time, we follow Bitty and his teammates throughout college, as well as Bitty's journey as a young gay man.

Ngozi Ukazu's series has been published in physical volumes, but it got its start as a free webcomic in 2013, and its storytelling blossomed into an official Tumblr, Twitter, and various other forms of storytelling. If you want a queer, heartfelt story to get you through self-quarantine - or you're just really missing sports - Check, Please! might be a good place to start.




Coffin Bound

Coffin Bound follows Izzy, a young woman who is sent on a literal trip down memory lane after being targeted by a hitman. With the help of a macabre cast of characters, Izzy sets out on one major road trip, as she seeks to erase all trace of herself — and prevent the men in her life from manipulating her history.

While only a few issues in, Coffin Bound is one of the coolest and most profound comics that has been published in the past year. Dan Watters and Dani craft a punk rock, grindhouse tale of legacy, self-preservation, and body horror, and now is as good of a time as ever to dive into it. 




Crowded

(Photo: Image Comics)Available on: Comixology, Hoopla

For a completely-different kind of assassin-tinged road trip story, you should absolutely pick up Crowded. The series is set in an alternate version of our present, where assassinations are crowdfunded through an app called Reapr. This begins to cause a major headache for Charlie Ellison, a seemingly-average young woman who suddenly has a very expensive bounty on her head. Teaming up with Vita - the lowest-rated bodyguard on the ""Dfend"" app - and an adorable chihuahua, Charlie needs to stay alive... and figure out who wants her dead. 

Christopher Sebela, Ro Stein  Ted Brandt, and company craft a hilarious and action-packed tale, which will make you look at human interaction and relationships in a whole new way.




Hark! A Vagrant

Kate Beaton might be one of the best cartoonists to rise to prominence in the past decade and a Hark! A Vagrant is the best distillation of her skills. The long-running webcomic has lampooned everything from centuries-old history to Nancy Drew covers, with some legitimately hilarious results.

No matter where you dive into Hark! A Vagrant, each comic will bring a satisfying, but brilliantly-constructed short-form storytelling.




iZombie

iZombie is about as self-contained and genuinely creative as you can get. The series, which was part of DC's (now-defunct) Vertigo label from 2010-2012, follows Gwen Dylan, a young-woman-turned-zombie in Eugene, Oregon. Gwen is forced to moonlight as a gravedigger to feed her appetite for brains, which allows her to access the memories of the brains she's eating.

While the comic is definitely different from The CW's fan-favorite television adaptation, both versions of iZombie have quite a lot to love. Plus, what other comic has a supporting cast that includes a ghost from the 1960s and a ""were-terrier""?




Lady Killer

(Photo: Dark Horse Comics)Available on: Comixology, Hoopla

Another female-led and obsession-worthy comic that deserves more attention is Joelle Jones' Lady Killer. The series, which is published in two volumes, follows Josie Schuller In the 1950s. A seemingly-perfect housewife, Josie moonlights as a contract killer, only the two sides of her life to intersect in a deadly way. 

If you've been following Jones' recently-concluded Catwoman run, Lady Killer is a perfect way to keep the momentum going. If not, it's still just an incredibly entertaining and gorgeously-rendered comic.




On a Sunbeam

Tillie Walden is another cartoonist and artist who has put out consistently-stellar work, and On a Sunbeam is no exception. The series, which was initially published as a webcomic, follows Mia, the member of a team in charge of rebuilding structures in space. As the story goes along, Mia and her fellow crew members must come to terms with their own losses.

On a Sunbeam is bizarre and truly breathtaking with visuals to match. While you should also buy the collected edition, which was published in 2018, the webcomic is a cost-effective way to experience the story for yourself.




Nancy

While Nancy has been a fixture of comic strips since the 1930s, Olivia Jaimes' recent run on the character has helped her become something truly special. Jaimes has been the first female author to take on the title, giving the sarcastic titular young character the modern, but earnest edge that the comic world didn't know it desperately needed.

The first nine months of Jaimes' Nancy run have been collected into a snazzy hardcover, but her past nearly-two years of strips are also available for free courtesy of GoComics. Get ready to be genuinely entertained by Nancy (and to find out exactly why Sluggo is lit.)




Motor Crush

Brendan Fletcher, Cameron Stewart, and Babs Tarr helped usher Batgirl into a new era, and they bring their energetic and truly stylish energy to Motor Crush. The series follows Domino Swift, a professional motorcycle racer who secretly races in underground fights, in hopes of gaining a new drug named Crush.

Motor Crush has so much action, heart, and Instagram-worthy aesthetics, while offering a poignant tale about identity and family. While there are only two volumes out so far, they're absolutely worth joining the ride for. 




Tank Girl

Available on: Comixology, Hoopla

Let's be honest -- you don't really need an excuse to dive into Tank Girl comics, but the recent anniversary of the beloved '90s movie (and the fact that Margot Robbie's LuckyChap is producing a new reboot) certainly help. The irreverent post-apocalyptic series follows Rebecca Buck, a woman who travels around with a mutant kangaroo named Booga in a literal tank.

Regardless of wherever you start reading Tank Girl (and really, you can start anywhere), you're in for a punk-inspired and irreverent journey. Plus, with the world feeling more and more chaotic every day, there could be a bit of comfort in following the adventures of Tank Girl."

To relay and communicate accurate scientific information in regional languages about the ongoing pandemic, the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) and a few other national institutions have launched CovidGyan, a website that offers short videos, pictorial info-graphics, posters, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), myth busters and research-oriented articles on COVID-19. Scientists from the Indian Institute of Science, Tata Memorial Centre, LifeScience Cluster, IndiaBiosciene and Vigyan Prasar have teamed up in this multi-lingual communication exercise. Presently, information about coronavirus has been made available in English along with twelve Indian languages covering Hindi, Assamese, Bangla, Gujarati, Kannada, Konkani, Marathi, Malayalam, Odiya, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu. Rajesh Gopakumar, director, International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, said the idea of the website is to create, curate and communicate scientifically all credible and authentic COVID-19 related content. Scientists at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) have pooled their knowledge and expertise for this cause. At the time of COVID-19, it is important to utilise our scientific understanding of the biological world. This can be used to provide a holistic perspective on the situation.,” said Satyajit Mayor, director, NCBS. Similarly, a team of scientists, engineers and journalists came together on Saturday to bust myths around COVID-19.

55	Daily Mail UK	943392	Liz Hoggard	My lightbulb moment: Soap-maker Emma Heathcote-James	"Emma Heathcote-James, 43, founded Little Soap Company in 2008 to make pure, natural bar soap accessible to all. It became the first all-natural organic soap on supermarket shelves. She lives in the Cotswolds with her wife, a conservationist, and their son, 15.

Soap was my grandmother’s passion, and when she got back from a holiday she would give us a paper bag full of the most delicious handmade soap. After she died we found her wardrobe stacked with unused soap.

When I moved to the Cotswolds, I became frustrated that I couldn’t buy proper soap in supermarkets. Back in 2008, it was all coal tar or synthetic detergent bars, which dried out your skin. So I began making soap as a hobby. I bought raw oils and essential oil and started perfecting recipes.

From the start it was important the soap was ethical, sustainable, vegan and cruelty-free. I began by selling to farm shops, then at farmers’ markets. Then, before the end of the first three months, I got the soap into the local independent supermarket. As I now knew how to produce a barcode, I thought I might as well try Waitrose. I persuaded the buyer to talk to me, and she put it in eight local stores.

Next, I was speaking at a ‘women in rural business’ conference and, unbeknown to me, a buyer from Tesco was in the audience.

They asked me to create a range for the supermarket and be a regional supplier.

Along the way, the best business decision I made was taking time to do the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses programme at Aston University in Birmingham. It took five months (like a mini master of business administration course) and enabled me to take the business off the kitchen table by taking on a premises and staff.

The soaps are now sold in eight major supermarkets and retailers, and they are all made in Britain.

No one could have foreseen that our soap would be suddenly playing a crucial role in the fight against the spread of coronavirus.

A bar lasts a lot longer than a bottle of hand wash, so works out far cheaper. You’re also reducing plastic and landfill waste, while protecting yourself.

The bars have naturally occurring glycerine locked inside, too, so are super moisturising — great for constant hand-washing."

It looks like more and more we'll be using it for that,"" Trump told reporters at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House. ""The ship is ready and if we need it for the virus, we'll use it for that.""

The USNS Comfort had originally been designated as a space for non-coronavirus patients to alleviate the pressure from New York hospitals.

The US coronavirus death toll is now more than triple that of the 9/11 attacks, with almost half of the known pandemic-related deaths in New York.

There are at least 331,151 cases of coronavirus in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University's latest tally of cases. At least 9,441 people have died in the nation from the virus.

Earlier Sunday, the US surgeon general said this week is going to be the ""hardest and the saddest"" for ""most Americans' lives,"" describing the upcoming period of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States as a ""Pearl Harbor moment"" and a ""9/11 moment."" ""This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment, only it's not going to be localized, it's going to be happening all over the country and I want America to understand that,"" Vice Admiral Jerome Adams said on ""Fox News Sunday."""

Tony Spell of Life Tabernacle Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. ""We'd rather obey God than man.""

About 1,220 people attended, some bused in and others driving more than 100 miles to attend, Spell told CNN. Spell has previously told CNN he believes the pandemic is ""politically motivated.""

The Rev. Alvin Gwynn Sr. of Friendship Baptist Church in Baltimore, Maryland, said he had a steady stream of people walking through the church, processional style, careful not to have more than eight or nine.

Religious organizations should be on the list of essential organizations, he told CNN. In Jupiter, Florida, some 20 people attended service at Ascend Church, CNN affiliate WPEC reported. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has exempted worship services from the state's current coronavirus orders. Parishioners attend a Palm Sunday worship service at City On A Hill Church in Houston, Texas. The service was held in the church's parking lot and the church practiced social distancing during the service. Some churches, like Amplified Church in San Antonio , Texas, and Calvary's Hill Church in Bluefield, Virginia, held drive-in services with loudspeakers. ""Our pastor at Amplified Church, like many other pastors are trying to do their best to keep the people connected and safe; still abiding by the social distancing regulations,"" a church spokesperson told CNN via Facebook. ""It has been a challenge, but we are thankful even in the midst of this pandemic that we can spread the gospel,"" the message said. Police are arresting and fining people for violating social distancing orders Despite several clusters of Covid-19 sicknesses traced to congregations -- at least 70 cases were traced to a single church in Sacramento, California -- other states are also allowing services to continue. ""Churches by and large do the right thing, they want to protect their parishioners,"" Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson told reporters Sunday. ""There are a few that have a very small attendance and they socially distance. We don't recommend that, but if it's within the guidelines, then that's understandable."" Hutchinson did mention officials ""had trouble with a church putting parishioners at risk."" After the health department called them, ""they took the right steps and are not meeting"" with a large congregation, Hutchinson said. Some local leaders have been speaking out against exempting church services from a ban on gatherings and are asking churches to hold them online. 'Not what we need right now' ""I know it's a very difficult thing, as a Catholic, Easter Sunday for me next week, Palm Sunday today,"" said Boston Mayor Marty Walsh. ""But that is not what we need right now. We need prayers right now, that's what we need."" Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez thanked religious leaders who were holding services online in lieu of regular mass on Palm Sunday, he said in a video briefing on YouTube. Quarantine life is starting to feel like a real Lent ""That's the safest way to keep us all connected,"" Gimenez said. ""Let's help us all stay safer at home during these religious holy days."" The Archdiocese of Miami suspended all Masses and events on March 16 and encouraged parishes to use livestreaming when possible, Archbishop Thomas Wenski said this week on CNN's New Day. The number of Covid-19 cases rose to at least 331,151 nationwide Sunday, and at least 9,441 people have died, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University"

According to the classmates, Crozier started showing symptoms before he was removed from command of the warship on Thursday.

On Saturday, US President Donald Trump said he supported the decision to remove US aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt Captain Brett Crozier over the captain’s inappropriate email regarding the COVID-19 outbreak.

He stressed that the captain could have called and made certain suggestions but it was inappropriate for him to send a letter and to stop in Vietnam, where sailors got off the ship and then ended up being infected.

US Congressmen Ted Lieu and Ruben Gallego on Friday wrote a letter to Defence Department Inspector General Glenn Fine urging him to open an investigation into the removal of Capt. Brett Crozier.

In total, 155 sailors on USS Theodore Roosevelt have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, according to the US Navy.

On Thursday, US Navy Acting Secretary Thomas Modly announced he had made the decision to remove Captain Brett Crozier because he improperly sent an email about his concerns regarding the COVID-19 outbreak on the ship using channels that were not secure to convey confidential information."

Photos of Dr Calderwood and her family at her holiday home on the east coast were published in the Scottish Sun on late Saturday, triggering wide public discontent, as just a day earlier she posted her family picture from her residence in Edinburgh. It was also revealed that she had violated quarantine for the second time, which spiked even more dissatisfaction.

Dr Calderwood later offered an apology for her irresponsible actions.

Dr Calderwood had previously been actively urging citizens to stay at home to curb the spread of the virus.

Quarantine measures were announced in the UK on Monday, to be reviewed in three weeks if they can be relaxed.

As of Sunday, the UK government confirmed a total of 19,522 COVID-19 cases, with the death toll from coronavirus-related complications reaching 1,228."

621	Quartz	1182578	Katherine Ellen Foley	How to read coronavirus news like a science writer	"In the current climate of Covid-19, health and science news dominates headlines everywhere.
It’s arguably the first “infodemic,” as news spreads literally virally across social media and media outlets. In a time of uncertainty, we hunger for information. Yet even though internet access means much news is at our fingertips, it’s not always easy to evaluate the quality of what we’re reading—and what it actually means about the state of science.
If you’re being bombarded with facts about Covid-19 and aren’t sure whether to trust them, think like we do here at Quartz. Questioning new information with a measured sense of skepticism and a little digging can help you avoid taking in sensationalized information. The following is good advice not just during this pandemic, but any time you pick up the health and science section of a given publication.
Remember the warp-speed timeline
Covid-19 is caused by a virus, SARS-CoV-2, that no one knew about until a few months ago. Scientists have not had time to study it in-depth. Much of what they’re learning is based on what we’re observing from an epidemiological standpoint and what we know about other viruses, like the flu and SARS.
The quality of science is good—it just isn’t as robust as other fields are yet. The pandemic has sparked an unprecedented amount of international research collaboration. Scientists are working around the clock to figure out new ways to treat the virus and develop vaccines against it. Journals are publishing pre-prints of papers as soon as they can to make sure that everyone has access to the most up-to-date information, rather than waiting for a period of review and to publish within a particular issue.
Remember that new information may be true, but hasn’t had time to be validated by other studies just yet. “This kind of healthy skepticism does not mean you’re dismissing everything as false—it simply means remembering the things you hear could be false, but they could also be true…or they could be something in between,” Emma Frans, an epidemiology and psychiatry researcher at Oxford University in the UK and Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, told TED.
Weigh the scientific evidence
When a headline claims a new study uncovered a truth about Covid-19, look for a link to the study in the article—or at least a scientific journal named so you can find it on your own. You don’t have to read the whole paper (if you can access it) to get a sense of what it’s about, although it’s great if you can.
First, make sure the actual scientific article seems to reflect what the news is saying. Is it even, in fact, about Covid-19? Or is it about another biological process that may have implications for the spread or severity of the disease?
If it is about Covid-19, see what kind of research it is. Many of the papers coming out about Covid-19 are observational studies, in which researchers report what happened to a group of people in a certain setting. These studies can be great—particularly if they have a sample size of more than 1,000 people. They can point researchers to correlations, or patterns of outcomes in certain circumstances. (You should be skeptical of papers that only write up one person, called a case study, or a handful of people. These are too small to make meaningful assumptions about the general public.)
Observational studies may be biased in the kinds of people they study (for example, only those who got sick enough to go to the hospital). They also can’t tell scientists why something is happening on a biological level, or the causation. They’re reporting what happened to a group of people in a way that may be able to inform what may happen to others in similar circumstances.
Ideally, any observational study would have some sort of lab study that presents more research that could lead to a reason why the observed outcome happened (as with this study and accompanying article). Scientists haven’t had time to do many lab studies on SARS-CoV-2 just yet, so unfortunately this information isn’t widely available.
For any research claiming that a treatment or vaccine works, remember that the highest standard of evidence is a randomized controlled trial. In these experiments, some participants receive a placebo intervention, some get the tested intervention, and neither clinicians nor participants know what they received. Researchers may not have time to do these kinds of studies—which, again, doesn’t mean that anything less is bad. It’s just a reminder that the science isn’t certain just yet.
It’s also common for scientists to publish reviews or meta-analyses, which are papers that gather and weigh the evidence of specific papers. Given that Covid-19 is so new, many researchers are putting forth ideas that could be good places to look in the future. These papers are helpful, but they can’t be taken as the absolute truth. Unfortunately, one such paper hypothesizing that ibuprofen could worsen cases of Covid-19 led to a panic about the pain reliever, despite the fact that there’s only anecdotal evidence. It could be true—but again, scientists don’t know yet.
See where the information is coming from…
Did you read your information on a news website? Or did it come from a social media post? If the latter, were you asked to share it on? If so, tell us—but also increase your skepticism.
If you’re having trouble figuring out if your source is a trusted one, remember that no trusted news outlets will be touting remedies or cures—those don’t exist for this virus (or most conditions, frankly).
Quality science writing outlines all of the information described above about a study, and states which research institutions the scientists came from. Ideally, there’s also an outside source weighing in on the new information being presented. And it should always note the study’s limitations, or what it can’t tell researchers.
…And who else supports it
If you’re reading a news story that no other outlet else is reporting on, and the information doesn’t seem like anything else you’ve read—chances are you should be extra skeptical.
And above all, the top sources you should trust for research about Covid-19 are the national and international public health groups. As Quartz previously reported, the World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control, the National Health Service in the UK, or the Public Health Agency of Canada are your best bets."

Ferrari's Charles Leclerc showed he was useful in Virtual Formula One too as he dominated at the Australian Grand Prix.

Modified 06 Apr 2020, 04:40 IST









          Charles Leclerc
Three weeks after he had hoped to be starring in Formula One's Australian Grand Prix, Charles Leclerc saw the chequered flag confirm a virtual victory in Melbourne.
In the second event of F1's Virtual Grand Prix Series - an Esports tournament filling the gap while the real thing is suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic - FDA Hublot Esports driver Leclerc delivered a dominant performance.
Leclerc, who won back-to-back races in Belgium and Italy during his debut season with Ferrari in 2019, was on pole and never looked troubled around Albert Park, winning after 29 laps.
Renault's Christian Lundgaard was second, with Williams' George Russell finishing third, denying Arthur Leclerc a place on the podium alongside his brother.
""It was unbelievably hard,"" Charles Leclerc said.
""We are sitting on a chair so there's not even the g-force we have in a real car.
""But I'm sweating like crazy. The muscles are not hurting but [with] the concentration and everything I've been sweating a lot.""
Having seen singer Liam Payne, once of One Direction, struggle during the first race of the series, an early crash left England all-rounder Ben Stokes playing catch-up.
                                

Stokes would finish 18th out of 18 drivers, one spot behind three-time F1 race winner Johnny Herbert.
""It's the taking part that counts...it's what I always tell my kids,"" Stokes wrote on Twitter.
Former F1 world champion Jenson Button finished 12th and had a better time of it than Lando Norris, who was unable to take his place on the grid due to technical difficulties.
""I pressed to join the race and it just said, 'Sorry, you're not allowed to join the race',"" Norris revealed on Twitch in a chat with Max Verstappen.
Upon learning of Norris' struggles, Red Bull's Verstappen replied: ""Yeah, I will never join that.""

        People who make their living from outdoors pursuits have told of the dramatic effect coronavirus has had on their businesses.
Kayaking coach Zoe Newsam said her bookings dropped ""precipitously"" when social distancing began to be discussed.
The lockdown saw the ""tap being turned off completely"" on bookings.
Climbing instructor Alan Halewood said months-worth of upcoming work for him was also in doubt.
Beauly-based Zoe, who has been coaching since 2013 and running her own business for five years, travelled UK-wide for her work.
Her work started to drop off in the early days of the virus outbreak in the UK.
She said: ""With the introduction of travel restrictions, and then social distancing measures were put into place, the only thing to do was to cancel or postpone all courses for the foreseeable future.  
""When the announcement came that we were to avoid non-essential travel, it almost came as a relief - but one that resulted in a very empty diary. Overnight, all my paying work disappeared at the time of year when I'd be expecting bookings to be picking up.""

        Zoe came up with alternative ways of earning a little money such as offering personal training via video calling, but she said: ""Every other trainer did the same thing, so the market is suddenly flooded with fitness coaches.""
She said the government self-employed assistance scheme would help ""a little"" but, because her profits have been consistently low, it would not be enough to cover mortgage and other bills. She is also not eligible for benefits as her partner is still working.
Zoe is going to work part-time as a temporary supermarket delivery driver to help make ends meet, and to help supply other people with food.
She said: ""I'm trying very hard not to think about the future. The scale of what lies ahead just feels too large.  
""I worry that the market for outdoor sports won't return for a while, as people struggle with lack of money once the crisis is eventually over. 
""I worry that we will be restricted in our travel for some time to come, meaning that some of my work will be impossible to undertake.  
""This crisis certainly brings home the fragility of our industry, and the lack of security inherent in it. We spend many thousands of hours and pounds on training, but rarely make much money from it.""
'My work diary emptied overnight'
Lochaber-based Matt Haydock's paddle sports business Rapid Development had a full work diary through to the middle of 2021 before the coronavirus outbreak. 
""Since the prime minister's first big announcement on 16 March, which put in place the initial social distancing measures, my entire work diary emptied literally overnight. All planned activities, trips, coaching sessions were cancelled outright,"" he said.
More stringent measures soon followed, and Matt said: ""My Google Calendar emptied itself, and I was looking at no possible income stream, almost immediately.  
""Coming to terms with this was pretty daunting to say the least, particularly before the government announced any form of support package.""
Matt holds on to a hope the industry can bounce back, but he said: ""Alongside the fears we all share of losing loved ones, catching the virus, and this lasting six months or more, I am deeply fearful for the outdoor industry when we exit this crisis.  
""For most in the outdoors, many have just come out the other side of a harsh winter with little work, ready to make money to cover themselves as the main season commences.""
'Work has come to a crashing halt'
Climbing instructor and guide Alan has been working for himself under his business Climb When You're Ready and as a freelance for others for 11 years.
His work includes providing training and assessments at Glenmore Lodge, the Scottish National Outdoor Training Centre in the Cairngorms.
""My first day's work cancelled was 16 March. All work for the immediate future went on hold overnight,"" he said.
""I should have had 13 days of work since then and I've cancelled 44 more days up to the end of May. 
""Beyond that I've another 50 days beyond that that are all threatened. I'm also usually busy filling my diary up to six months ahead at this point but all new enquiries have disappeared and ongoing discussions on dates with existing clients are on hold indefinitely. 
""Work has come to a crashing halt and income has dried up overnight.""
Alan said one regular employer had honoured a payment as a cancellation fee for a handful of bookings and one larger overseas contract had a 25% cancellation fee built it.
He said those in the outdoor industry were trying to find alternative employment, and also offer help to their communities.
""Outdoors professionals are all first aiders, are often good at problem solving and quite resilient,"" he said.
""I know some have taken jobs in supermarkets and others are volunteering with the NHS and other bodies. We aren't used to being inactive.""

        Outdoor writer and photographer Chris Townsend said he was ""very concerned"" for instructors and guides.
He said: ""No-one works in the outdoors field to make money - we do it because we love it - so people don't have reserves to fall back on.

1478	Stuff	941156	Stuff	Coronavirus: Europe sees more signs of hope as Italy's Covid-19 curve falls	"A day shy of one month under a national lockdown that the Italian government ordered, the lower count of day-to-day deaths brought some encouragement.

Europe has seen further signs of hope in the coronavirus outbreak as Italy's daily death toll drops to its lowest in more than two weeks and its infection curve finally goes on a downward slope.

In Spain, new deaths dropped for the third straight day.

But the optimism was tempered by Britain's jump in virus deaths that outpaced the daily toll in Italy.

Angelo Borrelli, the head of Italy's Civil Protection agency said there were 525 deaths in the 24-hour period since Saturday evening (local time). That's the lowest such figure in the country since 427 deaths were registered on March 19.

Italy now had a total of 15,887 deaths and nearly 129,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases.

A day shy of one month under a national lockdown that the Italian government ordered, the lower count of day-to-day deaths brought some encouragement.

The number of intensive care unit beds occupied by coronavirus patients has also showed a decrease in the last few days, including in northern Lombardy, Italy's most stricken region.

Borrelli also noted with a measure of satisfaction that the number of those hospitalised but not in ICU beds also had decreased.

Italy recorded 4316 new cases on Sunday. Earlier in the outbreak, daily increases in caseloads topped the 6000 mark.

""The curve, which had been plateauing for days, is starting to descend,"" national health official Silvio Brusaferro told reporters, referring to graphs indicating daily numbers of confirmed cases.

But Borrelli warned: ""This good news shouldn't make us drop our guard.""

For days, anticipating a possible downward slope in the curve, government and health authorities in Italy have cautioned that restrictions on movement would likely last in some form for weeks.

The virus caused mild to moderate symptoms in most people, but for some, especially older adults and the infirm, it could cause severe pneumonia and lead to death.

Britain recorded 708 new coronavirus deaths on Saturday while Italy reported 631 deaths that day.

With 621 more deaths reported on Sunday, Britain had 4934 virus deaths overall among 47,806 cases. Those coming down with the virus in the UK included Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the health secretary, England's chief medical official and Prince Charles, heir to the British throne.

There are wide fears that Johnson's Conservative government didn't take the virus seriously enough at first and that beautiful spring weather would tempt Britons and others to break social distancing rules.

Restrictions on movement varied from country to country. In Germany and Britain, residents could exercise and walk their dogs, as well as go to the supermarket and do other essential tasks.

Swedish authorities had advised the public to practice social distancing, but schools, bars and restaurants were still open.

Spain announced 6023 confirmed new infections Sunday, taking its national tally to 130,759 but down from an increase of 7026 infections in the previous day.

Spain's confirmed new virus deaths dropped for the third straight day, to 674 - the first time daily deaths have fallen below 800 in the past week.

""We are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel,"" Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said.

In the United States, the state of New York reported 594 new coronavirus deaths on Sunday, fewer than the 630 it reported on Saturday, Governor Andrew Cuomo said at his daily news briefing.

The state had 4159 fatalities so far.

As US President Donald Trump and other leaders warned of rising death tolls, Cuomo said it was too early to say if the outbreak had reached a peak in New York - the centre of the nation's outbreak.

""You could argue that you are seeing a plateauing,"" he told reporters in Albany. ""Next week they will tell you whether we are on a plateau or is it just a blip,"" he said, referring to statisticians.

He noted that deaths had levelled off for three days after dramatic rises. The toll on Friday was 562.

New hospitalisations dropped to 574 on Sunday from 1095, Cuomo said. He said 74 per cent of those hospitalised have been discharged.

The state has a total of about 122,000 positive cases. New York City has 67,551 cases, up 4245 in a day."

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumer confidence has recorded its biggest fall in more than 45 years, a survey showed on Monday, as a widening shutdown of the economy to slow the spread of the coronavirus hammered households’ financial hopes. 
GfK, which has conducted monthly surveys of British consumer sentiment since 1974, ran an extra poll in late March which showed the weakest sentiment since February 2009. 
The drop in the index to -34 from -9 in its regular survey for March, conducted earlier in the month, was the biggest on record. 
“Our COVID-19 ‘flash report’ shows a dramatic result with consumer confidence falling off the cliff in the last two weeks of March,” GfK client strategy director Joe Staton said. 
Surveys of businesses have been similarly bleak. IHS Markit’s monthly purchasing managers’ index for the services and manufacturing sectors, published on Friday, pointed to the sharpest contraction on record.     
The biggest decline in the GfK survey came in households’ willingness to make major purchases, despite a spike in demand for freezers, televisions and home office equipment as people prepared to spend most of their time at home. 
GfK conducted the European Union-commissioned survey of 2,000 people between March 16 and March 27. Over this period Britain moved from advising people to avoid bars and restaurants to banning them from leaving their homes except to buy food, exercise or do essential work. 
Economists fear Britain’s economy, like many others around  the world, is heading for a severe recession but say a bounce-back is possible later in the year, depending on how the coronavirus outbreak develops.

But oil prices fell anew at the open of Asian trading as the weekend did not bring major producers Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States any closer to resolving a growing supply glut that is overwhelming markets.  
A month-long price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, against the backdrop of the pandemic, has cut the price of crude to $34 a barrel from $65. Members of OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, have stepped up efforts to resolve the dispute in recent days, but they have called on other big producers - including the United States - to be involved. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to meet Thursday - delayed from Monday - to discuss cutting production to alleviate a supply glut as fuel demand is expected to fall by about a third worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Oil prices hit an 18-year low on March 30 but have since rebounded somewhat. On Friday, Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled at $34.11 a barrel; in early Asia trading, prices fell to $32 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 fell to $26.15 a barrel on Sunday from a $28.34 close on Friday. [O/R] 
Major producers from members of OPEC, to Russia, the United States, and Canada, have all expressed hope that a production-cut deal would be worked out. However, the weekend was marked by ongoing sniping between Russia and Saudi Arabia over the demise of the previous OPEC agreement.  
President Donald Trump last week touted the possibility of a deal between Saudi Arabia and Russia to cut output by as much as 10 to 15 million barrels per day, but that would likely need the cooperation of nations that are not part of OPEC, where national governments do not exert control over private-company output.  
Iraq’s oil minister said on Sunday that any new deal needs support from key producers from outside the OPEC+ alliance, such as the United States, Canada and Norway. The White House has not suggested it would try to persuade producers to reduce output. 
National oil company Saudi Aramco (2222.SE) typically issues its Official Selling Prices (OSPs) by the 5th of each month, setting the trend for Iranian, Kuwaiti and Iraqi prices and affecting more than 12 million barrels of oil per day bound for Asia. CRU/OSP 
“That’s a pretty clear sign that they are open to cutting in May,” said Robert McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group in Bethesda, Maryland.      
The OPEC+ meeting was initially due to take place on Monday, but was postponed to April 9 “to allow for more time to reach out to all producers, including OPEC+ and others”, the Saudi source said. 
“It is an unprecedented measure that has not been taken by Aramco before. May OSPs will depend on how the OPEC+ meeting concludes. We are doing what we can to make it (the meeting) successful, including taking this extraordinary step to delay the OSPs,” the Saudi source said. 
The Saudi source said that Riyadh wants to avoid a repeat of the outcome of a March meeting where oil talks collapsed due to Russia’s refusal to cut output. 
The kingdom’s aggressive price cuts in early March shocked the oil industry, kicking off a downward spiral in the oil market that accelerated with the worsening of the coronavirus pandemic.  
Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed the crash in prices on Saudi Arabia on Friday, prompting a firm response from Riyadh the following day disputing Putin’s claims. 
On Sunday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia wants constructive talks on the situation in the oil market and sees no alternative to dialogue, Interfax news agency reported.  
“Russia was not in favour of terminating the OPEC+ deal. President Putin and Russia are committed to a constructive negotiation process, which does not have an alternative for stabilising the international energy market,” Peskov said. 
Coordinated cuts between OPEC+ members expired on March 31, having helped support crude prices since they began in January 2017. 
Trump has made no commitment to take the extraordinary step of persuading U.S. companies to cut output. The idea of Washington curbing production has long been seen as impossible, not least because of U.S. antitrust laws. 
On Saturday, Trump threatened to impose tariffs on crude imports in an effort to force Saudi Arabia, Russia and other major producers to agree to production cuts.

Still, governors of eight states resisted issuing stay-at-home orders aimed at slowing the spread of the respiratory disease, and some churches held large Palm Sunday services in defiance of such orders in their states. 
New York, the hardest-hit state, reported on Sunday that for the first time in a week, deaths had fallen slightly from the day before, but there were still nearly 600 new fatalities and more than 7,300 new cases. Places such as Pennsylvania, Colorado and Washington, D.C., are starting to see rising deaths.  
“This is going to be the hardest and the saddest week of most Americans’ lives, quite frankly. This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment, only it’s not going to be localized,” U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams warned on Fox News on Sunday. “It’s going to be happening all over the country. And I want America to understand that.” 
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Sunday that new hospitalizations had fallen by 50% over the previous 24 hours. He cautioned that it was not yet clear whether the crisis was reaching a plateau in the state, which has a total of 4,159 deaths and more than 122,000 cases. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2w7hX9T) 
Once the peak of the epidemic passes, Cuomo said a mass rollout of rapid testing would be critical to help the nation “return to normalcy.”  
Most states have ordered residents to stay home except for essential trips to slow the spread of the virus in the United States, where more than 335,000 people have tested positive and over 9,500 have died, according to a Reuters tally. 
But eight states, all of them with Republican governors, have yet to order residents to stay home: Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming. Georgia, which has recorded 6,600 cases and more than 200 deaths, ordered residents to stay home but then allowed some beaches to reopen. 
Republican Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson defended his refusal to order statewide restrictions, saying the situation was being watched closely and that his more “targeted approach” was still slowing the spread of the virus. 
Adams, the surgeon general, said governors who had not issued month-long stay-at-home orders should at least consider one for the upcoming week.     
CHURCH BUSES IN PARISHIONERS 
A few churches were holding large gatherings on Palm Sunday, the beginning of Holy Week in Christian churches.  
Pastor Tony Spell, who was arrested last week for holding services, summoned his faithful again, three weeks after Louisiana banned gatherings of 10 people or more. 
Hundreds of worshippers converged on Spell’s Life Tabernacle megachurch in a suburb of Baton Rouge, many arriving in 26 buses sent to pick them up. Everyone but immediate family members kept at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart, a lawyer for the pastor said. 
“They would rather come to church and worship like free people than live like prisoners in their homes,” Spell told reporters. 
Louisiana has become a hot spot for the virus, reporting a jump in deaths to nearly 500 and more than 13,000 cases. The governor predicted the state would run out of ventilators by Thursday. 
Michigan reported 1,493 new cases on Sunday and a further 77 fatalities, taking the state’s death toll to 617.  
New York Mayor Bill De Blasio said the city had enough ventilators to get through Tuesday or Wednesday, and he was seeking between 1,000 and 1,500 more from federal and state stockpiles, which he estimated had 10,000 and 2,800, respectively. 
Oregon, which has reported around 1,000 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, said it was sending New York 140 ventilators, machines that help people breathe after the virus attacks their lungs. Washington is returning over 400 of the machines to the Strategic National Stockpile for hard-hit states like New York. 
White House medical experts have forecast that between 100,000 to 240,000 Americans could be killed in the pandemic, even if sweeping orders to stay home are followed.  
President Donald Trump said in a Tweet on Sunday that “a rough two weeks are coming up.” 
Washington state Governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat, whose state has seen cases flatten after early action, said if other states did not also impose strict measures, the virus would simply circulate. 
Kate Lynn Blatt, 38, a property manager from rural Pottsville, Pennsylvania, said she was astounded that her state’s governor, Tom Wolf, waited until last Wednesday to issue a statewide stay-at-home order. 
“We were shocked. I can’t believe Trump hasn’t issued a nationwide order and I still can’t believe there are states that are still open,” Blatt said.

2491	CBS Local	943723	Wcco | Cbs Minnesota	Coronavirus In Minnesota: Family Celebrates 'Best Papa In The Entire World' Who Died From COVID-19	"MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — A Minnesota family is sharing their message after a beloved grandfather became one of the state’s COVID-19 victims.

Scott Melter of Wyoming just retired last year. The 60-year-old, who had COPD, had also beat lung cancer last year. But on Wednesday, COVID-19 took his life.

Krystal Pearl’s Melter daughter, says he leaves behind a large family, and an even larger legacy. 

“He always wanted everybody to feel so loved,” Pearl said. “He was the best Papa in the entire world to his grandchildren. He would always take them on special ‘Papa dates.’ He would show up in a suit with flowers.”

She also spoke of his generosity.

“Everything that he owned, he wanted to share with everybody, he wanted people to experience,” Pearl said. “He loved vacationing, he loved bringing people on vacations so they could experience things.”

And that’s exactly what he did early last month. The family traveled to Mexico as word of COVID-19 started to spread.

“We had even talked about it on vacation, you know. He had said, ‘Yeah, you know, it’s not going to be good if somebody like me gets it,'” Pearl said.

So after the trip, Melter and his beloved wife of 35 years left their Ridgeland, South Carolina winter home to come back to Minnesota.

“I had said, you know, ‘I want you here so that we can just keep you home and away from everything and we can help you out,'” Pearl said.

It was on the drive to what they thought was safety that they realized Melter was in danger.

“He just had said he was just kind of tired, and he wasn’t feeling real well. He actually was like, ‘I’m not overly concerned, I don’t think it’s COVID because, like, the symptoms that I’m having don’t really line up with what they’re saying,’ but then obviously it progressed pretty quickly after that,” Pearl said.

Melter was admitted to M Health Fairview in Wyoming on March 25. That would be the last day he would ever see his wife. He tested positive for COVID-19 and was put in isolation at Bethesda Hospital in St. Paul.  

“We were able to have one person be with him when we knew that he wasn’t going to get better, so that was my brother,” Pearl said. “We decided as a family that he should go because I was just on the trip with him.  I’m so grateful that my brother, that they allowed him to be there and to FaceTime us so we could say our goodbyes. It was special.”

Now, Pearl hopes that anyone who hears her father’s story does not feel fear, but instead, peace.

“There is a lot of good happening, and there’s a lot of light being spread, and a lot of love being spread, and that’s what my dad would want,” Pearl said. “He would want people to know God’s got this, you know, we’re going to be OK.”

Melter’s wife, Treva, is now alone in quarantine, but says she feels lots of love through FaceTime. The family has decided to wait and hold a celebration of life for Melter sometime in the future."
466	News	942911	Log In	No shortage of flu vaccine, Premier says	"Premier Steven Marshall says an apparent shortage of flu shots is possibly because people are getting them earlier this year.
He said he would speak to Health Minister Stephen Wade about the shortage, after reports emerged of pharmacies cancelling appointments at the weekend.
He told ABC News this morning SA had ordered “more flu vaccines than even last year”.
“I think there’s a general high level of anxiety for people who are jumping in early to get those earlier,” he said.
“The pattern of people going to get the flu vaccine has completely changed this year, but my understanding is that we’ve got plenty of flu vaccines. We’ll have more to say about that later today.”
Mr Marshall also said SA’s COVID-19 numbers had been increased by cruise ships.
The Ruby Princess docks in NSW today, with about 200 crew members suffering coronavirus-like symptoms.
Cruise ships have resulted in 120 of SA’s cases, the majority from the Ruby Princess when it docked in Sydney last month.
“It’s a disaster, let’s be quite clear,” he said.
“The reality is that South Australia was disproportionately affected. I think now we’re over 125 infections that come off of cruise ships.
”I don’t know what it is about South Australians and cruising, but we have been disproportionately affected with well over a quarter, heading towards a third, of all of our cases from cruise (ships), and that’s really skewing our figures on the national stage.”
A criminal investigation has begun into how the Ruby Princess was allowed to disembark hundreds of passengers that brought COVID-19 into the community.
SA had two new cases of COVID-19 on Sunday, as the State Government said nearly 100 new paramedics would be fast-tracked into frontline service.
It also announced a historic deal with the state’s private hospitals at the weekend, underwriting them to open 1700 beds, increase SA’s intensive care unit capabilities by 40 per cent and keep medical staff in jobs.
Senior Government sources also revealed concerns about how the public system would cope if private hospitals closed after all non-elective surgeries were cancelled last week to shore up beds.
The partnership would include public-sector use of wards and theatres, essential equipment such as ventilators, as well as personal protective equipment supplies from all private hospitals."

Ashley Iasimone
 









In the midst of quarantine parenting, things got scary for P!nk, who tested positive for COVID-19 alongside her 3-year-old son, Jameson.

The singer, who revealed their diagnosis earlier this week, had a long discussion about her family's experience with the coronavirus with friend and author Jen Pastiloff on Instagram on Sunday (April 5). The live chat was part of a ""Chat and Feed"" series to raise money to feed people in need.

""I haven't dressed up in three weeks. I really needed it. Thank you for the opportunity,"" P!nk said as she began to talk about this ""crazy time.""


""We have been really, really sick,"" she noted. ""My 3-year-old, Jameson, has had the worst of it. I've had many nights where I've cried and I've never prayed more in my life.""

""At one point I heard myself saying, 'I thought they promised us our kids would be OK.' And it's not guaranteed. There's no one that is safe from this,"" said P!nk, who later described her 3-year-old as ""perfectly fine"" before contracting COVID-19. Although she and Jameson fell ill, her husband Carey and daughter Willow did not.

""Jameson's been really, really sick,"" she explained. ""I've kept a journal of his symptoms for the past three weeks, and mine as well. He still, three weeks later, has a 100 temperature ... It's been a roller coaster. It's been a different roller coaster for both of us.""

Though he is doing better, Jameson's symptoms have included ""a fever for three weeks and diarrhea and then constipation and then throwing up and pale and listless and lethargic and all the things that scare the bejeezus out of you as a mama.""

""He says the worst part was the prune juice,"" the pop star joked.

She went on to detail how COVID-19 affected her own health, explaining that while she has asthma, she is fit and the virus had her ""on nebulizers for the first time in 30 years"" -- and ""it got really, really scary, I'm not gonna lie.""

""Just when you think you're better, something else happens. It's been three weeks for me, four weeks for him,"" said the singer, who has donated  $1 million to support healthcare workers on the frontlines during the coronavirus pandemic.

WASHINGTON (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2020) US President Donald Trump has sent his well wishes to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson who has tested positive for COVID-19 and was urgently hospitalized on Sunday.
""He's a friend of mine, he's a great gentlema,n"" Trump said at the Sunday coronavirus White House briefing, expressing hope that Johnson would be fine and saying that he is a ""strong man.""
A source close to the UK healthcare authorities told Sputnik late on Sunday that Johnson was urgently hospitalized and that he would undergo artificial lung ventilation.
Earlier on Sunday, Johnson's Downing Street office said that the prime minister had been admitted to hospital as a precautionary step because he was exhibiting a high fever and a persistent cough.
On March 27, Johnson and UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock both announced that they had tested positive for COVID-19. On Friday, Johnson said in a video message that he was remaining in self-isolation, as he was still showing symptoms of the disease.
The prime minister said that he was continuing to carry out his duties and was communicating with other government ministers while in self-isolation to take measures to curb the spread of the disease.

1478	Stuff	941156	Stuff	Kiwi Willi Heinz on why Eddie Jones is his best rugby coach	"England head coach Eddie Jones announces an 'exciting' squad for the 2020 Six Nations. The 34-man squad features eight uncapped players.

England's Kiwi halfback Willi Heinz has backed the reappointment of Eddie Jones, describing him as ""the best coach I've played under"".

Heinz says Jones' attention to detail is second to none with the Australian signing a contract extension to coach England through to the next World Cup in France in 2023.

Whether Heinz gets there is doubtful. The former Crusaders and Canterbury No 9 is already 33 and admits his selection for the last World Cup in Japan where England finished runner-up to South Africa in an absorbing final came as a surprise.

""All I can say on behalf of the squad about Eddie is that we love the environment he creates,"" Heinz told The Rugby Paper.

""He's certainly the best coach I've played under in terms of attention to detail and the support he provides. It's a challenging environment but with that comes all that support and he makes sure you're in the best possible place to execute on any given day.""

Heinz played 58 games for the Crusaders from 2010-15 under the guidance of Todd Blackadder but also got to experience the magic of Scott Robertson with Canterbury.

Heinz felt Jones had proved his worth by the way he had righted the rocky England outfit in the leadup to the last World Cup and continued that with a strong Six Nations campaign this year that was eventually stalled by the coronavirus pandemic.

""I know England had a run of losses in 2018 but apart from that he's done amazing things with this team. To get to a World Cup final was impressive and although we lost that and then came back and dropped another game against France, since then our consistency has been good and that's down to the environment he creates,"" Heinz told The Rugby Paper.

""The players have a ton of respect for him and one of the things I've really noticed since being involved are the one-on-one relationship he seems to have with guys in the squad

""The relationships are there, you can see it in the conversations he has, and with 30-40 players to deal with he puts so much time into it.""

Heinz said he had benefited from that first-hand with Jones easing any doubts Heinz had about being called into test rugby at such a late age.

""Personally, that's helped me massively because coming into the set-up relatively late in your career, you do have question marks over whether you should be there or whether you're up to it. But he's been so good at simplifying the game and getting the best out of me,"" Heinz said.

""I love what he does for the No 9s and 10s in having loads of conversations between us about trends in the game, where the game's heading and what we can do to keep learning and influencing things ourselves. It's been an awesome experience under Eddie.""

Heinz is contracted to Gloucester in the English Premiership and has played 13 tests for England, including the World Cup semifinal demolition of the All Blacks. He was injured in that match, ruling him out of the final."
93	NPR	1625585	Hannah Hagemann	Australian Officials Launch Criminal Investigation Into Ruby Princess Cruise Ship	"The Ruby Princess cruise ship docked in Sydney on March 19 and nearly 2,700 passengers who were on board left freely, though some exhibited flu-like symptoms. On Sunday, Australian police announced they've launched a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess, citing questions over whether the operators of the ship, Carnival Australia, were transparent about sickened passengers and crew members.

More than 340 passengers have tested positive for the coronavirus and at least three passengers who contracted the virus on the cruise ship have died in recent days, according to the New South Wales Ministry of Health. Sixteen crew members have already tested positive for the virus, according to the New South Wales Police Force, while another 200 are exhibiting symptoms.

Police Commissioner Mick Fuller, speaking at a press conference, said that Australian authorities had made contact with the ship, ""And on each case, they were informed that COVID-19 wasn't an issue on the ship.""

""There seems to be absolute discrepancies between the information provided by Carnival and what I would see as the benchmark for the laws that the Federal Government and the State Government put in place in terms of protecting Australians from cruise ships when coronavirus had started,"" Fuller said. ""The only way I can determine whether our national biosecurity laws or our state laws were broken is through a criminal investigation.""

In a statement, a spokesman for Carnival Australia said the company would ""willingly"" cooperate with the investigation.

""Carnival Australia will vigorously respond to any allegations of which there must now be full disclosure and the basis for them,"" according to the statement.

While Fuller said there were ""many unanswered questions"" about the the Ruby Princess, ""there is clear evidence that corona-19 has been brought off that ship.""

As of Sunday, there were a total of 5,687 cases of coronavirus in Australia. At least 35 have died from the virus there, according to tracking by Johns Hopkins University."
18	Hacker News	2431996	Dave Lieber	If you imagine that a local business making surgical face masks is working 24/7, guess again	"When the history of the coronavirus epoch is written, The Watchdog hopes historians don’t neglect to mention Prestige Ameritech and its owner, Mike Bowen. The North Richland Hills company is America’s No. 1 maker of hospital surgical masks.
During this crisis, you’d think the company would be pushing forward on all cylinders, working 24/7 to manufacture the one commodity that Americans and the rest of the world want so badly.
You’d be wrong.
The company is only operating weekday shifts. You drive by nights and weekends and the employee parking lot is empty.
“People are curious why there aren’t any cars in the parking lot,” North Richland Hills Mayor Oscar Trevino told me.
And why is that, Mr. Mayor?
“The system got him,"" the mayor said about Bowen, who is executive vice president of the company. “And he’s unhappy about it.”
The story of Bowen’s unhappiness is a cautionary tale about what can happen if Americans searching for cheaper prices send entire industries offshore to countries like Mexico and China.
Everything Bowen has warned about has come true. He warned that allowing another country to serve as our main supplier of personal protection equipment has the potential to become a national security nightmare.
Bowen declined to talk to The Watchdog for this story. He’s busy.
“There is 200 times more demand than there is supply,” he told former presidential adviser Steve Bannon on Bannon’s podcast. “My phone is ringing every two minutes. Every one minute I am getting an email.”
An examination of his warnings going back more than a dozen years tells the story.
The common theme is that during an outbreak like this, everybody wants to be his customer. But as soon as an outbreak subsides, his customers dump him and run back to China. The reason? His masks may cost a dime each, but a made-in-China mask might go for two cents.
“Last time he geared up and went three shifts a day working his tail off,” the mayor recalled. “As soon as the issue died, he didn’t have any sales. He had to pay unemployment for all these people, and he had to gear down.”
As Bowen explained to Bannon, “I’ve been preaching this American-made story since 2007. Nobody listened. The whole mass market was only interested in price. I’ve been everywhere trying to get people to listen. I’ve talked to congressmen. I’ve talked to generals. I’ve written the president. I wrote President Obama five or six letters, and he sent me a presidential proclamation suitable for framing.”
Bowen wants a guaranteed contract, not a proclamation. It’s tough to win a bid to supply U.S. hospitals through their group purchase agreements that seek the cheapest price when your competitor pays low wages, ignores environmental concerns and is subsidized by a Communist government.
Last month, he got another proclamation but no contract to go with it. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, named Prestige Ameritech the “Senate Small Business of the Week.” The citation notes that the company “has ramped up their daily production to 600,000 masks.”
The company could do so much more.
The best intentions
The company is in a building originally used by Kimberly-Clark to make medical masks. But that company moved its operations to Mexico. When Prestige Ameritech opened in 2005, it was touted as a great day for the made-in-America movement.
By 2009, the company had grown strong enough to meet the demand caused by the H1N1 swine flu outbreak. Hospitals promised to stick with him afterward, but they broke their promise. The allure of cheaper Chinese masks was too great for hospital purchasing groups to ignore.
In 2010, the company celebrated a grand “reopening” when it renamed its factory the Global Pandemic Preparedness and Response Center. The event was attended by then-Gov. Rick Perry, who said, “It’s good news for America as America becomes competitive back in this arena again.”
VIDEO
But the news wasn’t so good. The next year, Bowen and company president Dan Reese had to lay off 150 workers. Bowen told Wired magazine, “150 people that saved a lot of hospitals from closing their doors were rewarded by losing their jobs. And that’s not going to happen again.”
The company nearly went bankrupt. In 2012 the company took out a million-dollar loan.
Mayor Trevino recalls escorting Bowen around the Texas Capitol in Austin as Bowen made his case with state lawmakers for more government support.
“He was begging them to understand that we shouldn’t have all our masks made in China. He wanted a federal government contract that would keep him in steady business,” the mayor said, adding that Bowen wanted to help build a future stockpile for a pandemic that Bowen predicted would happen.
Trevino recalls Bowen saying, “If y’all don’t care about me in good times when everybody’s OK, how am I going to be there when you need me?”
The city wrote letters on his behalf to federal lawmakers, Trevino said.
“Everything he was saying fell on deaf ears,” the mayor said.
Or as Bowen asked in a 2017 Dallas Morning News interview, “If the government doesn’t even buy American, who will?”
In that same interview, Bowen showed stacks of dismantled office cubicles.
Stacks of unused cubicles sat in the warehouse at the Prestige Ameritech manufacturing plant in North Richland Hills in 2017.(Rose Baca / Staff Photographer)“Every one of those represents somebody who used to have a job,” he said, adding that he nicknamed an empty, unlit corridor in his factory the “hall of death.”
He’s tired of being “the backup guy,” he said. “Create American jobs. Buy American. … It’s hot air.”
An empty darkened hallway at the Texas factory that serves as America's top domestic maker of medical face masks is nicknamed ""the Hall of Death"" — in memory of workers who were laid off when business was lost to China.(Rose Baca / Staff Photographer)Ramping up
That’s why if you drive by America’s No. 1 mask maker on a night or weekend, the parking lot is ghostly. But the lot isn’t completely empty. There’s a North Richland Hills police car parked outside near a police observation tower. The mayor said the business has received threats.
A mobile police tower and vehicle are positioned near the main entrance of Prestige Ameritech in North Richland Hills.(Tom Fox / Staff Photographer)Bowen told CBSDFW.com that he could only make about 1 million masks a day if he ran his machines 24/7. He said that would have little impact on global demand.
He told Bannon he is ramping up, but it takes weeks to build new machines and train employees. His company’s street sign announces it is hiring.
The nation's top domestic medical mask maker in Texas is hiring.(Tom Fox / Staff Photographer)The company is not selling to the general public or to non-American buyers. Now, it’s only selling to U.S. hospitals. But Bowen asks hospitals to sign contracts. Who can blame him?
Or as the mayor puts it, “He’ll gear back up, and he’ll produce, and they’ll probably do it to him again.”

This is because of a sudden increase in cases, the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. Admitting the shortage, UP health secretary, Amit Mohan Prasad said 31 units in the state had started manufacturing kits and that the government had also placed orders with other companies. He did not provide any break-up of the kits needed and procured by the government. A doctor in King George’s Medical University in Lucknow, the largest hospital in the city, has been infected. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIn other states such as Bihar, a large number of health workers have been provided with only masks, gloves and sanitisers -- and not coveralls. “To tide over the shortage of PPE kits, we have requested our doctors to utilise the kits rationally,” said Sanjay Kumar, Bihar’s principal secretary, health. The situation is no different in Madhya Pradesh’s biggest Covid-19 hot spot Indore, where only half of the health workers have been provided with proper kits. “Only 20 to 30% of around 55,000 to 60,000 health workers have been provided with proper kits in the state,” said MP’s health department employees’ association leader Laxminarayan Sharma. In the state, eight more health workers and staff tested positive on Sunday. All these officers used to meet one another in meetings held in the state secretariat and the health directorate and monitor implementation of the measures undertaken by the government across the state. At least 50 other officers, including head of the health department, are in self quarantine.State Commissioner of health services, Faiz Ahmad Kidwai, said, “We are providing PPE kits to health workers as per guidelines of government of India. Currently we are getting supplies from certain companies including some companies based at Indore. We are trying to get about 1.5 lakh kits in the coming days.”The northern states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttarakhand and the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Chandigarh have placed orders with private companies for the kits but haven’t received them yet. A health worker each in Chandigarh and J and two in Haryana have tested positive for Covid-19. Also Read: How Delhi answered PM Modi’s call to fight ‘coronavirus darkness’In Punjab’s Patiala and Amritsar districts, nurses protested outside hospitals, alleging a shortage of kits even though the official spokesperson for Covid-19, Rajesh Bhaskar, denied the charge. The Punjab cabinet has authorised additional chief secretary Vinni Mahajan to buy kits and masks for medical staff from manufacturers in the state and elsewhere. Haryana minister Anil Vij said tenders had been floated to get the kits. The eastern states of Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal have also reported a shortage of kits even though local manufacturing has started. Bihar has been supplied 16,700 PPE kits against its demand for 960,000 kits. Another 21,000 PPE kits are in transit. Jharkhand has 13,000 kits as against the demand of 21,000. Kumar said they were tapping all possible sources to get the kits. Jharkhand’s health minister, Banna Gupta, said the state government had placed orders with various companies. “We have also requested the central government to ensure supply of the kits but they are not listening to us,” Gupta said.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has also blamed the Centre although governor, Jagdeep Dhankhar, had claimed that there were enough kits with the state. Doctors in several hospitals in the state have protested and refused to report for work citing inadequate safety equipment.

The host of the Channel 5 programme, who grew up on a farm, urged people to have greater respect for farming and encouraged the public to have a more open dialogue about where food comes from and how it is produced.I live on the edge of the city, and theres a massive disconnect between food producers and the rest of the countryShe said: I obviously grew up on a farm, and have a huge amount of respect for farmers.But now I live on the edge of the city, and theres a massive disconnect between food producers and the rest of the country.And its funny because I lived in France for a few years and its very different there.You go to the market and you ask the farmer there what you should get, and he tells you and you buy it because thats whats best at that time of year.We dont do that over here. Like if we went into a supermarket and the guy behind the counter said, You should eat this, wed tell them to mind their own business.I think thats a shame. The former Blue Peter presenter said that she hopes the programme, which is returning for its third series later this month, encourages respect for farming.The show was scheduled to be broadcast live from a farm in Yorkshire, however producers have been forced to change their plan because of the Covid-19 pandemic.We wont even be sending a crew so no one will be put at risk at allSeries producer Richard Mortimer said: Luckily, a lot of the content has already been filmed over the past few weeks and in these somewhat unusual circumstances, we have found a way to carry on without a single person in the production having to leave their homes.Helen will present from her Yorkshire country garden and Adam from his Cotswold farm using high-quality iPhone cameras.We wont even be sending a crew so no one will be put at risk at all.Springtime On The Farm returns on April 13 at 8pm.
8639	Yahoo7 News Australia	2271495	By Dmitry Zaks	Italy's 'very long' lockdown to only end gradually	"Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's government prepared Italians for a ""very long"" lockdown Sunday that would only be lifted gradually despite its economic hardship and traumatic impact on daily lives.
The message from ministers and health officials came as Italy's world-topping toll rose by 756 -- well bellow Friday's record of 969 -- and the rate of coronavirus infections slowed to under six percent for the first time.
Yet the government appeared more focused on the nearing April 3 deadline to lift a national lockdown that had never been tried by a Western democracy -- and has since been replicated across Europe and the United States.
""The measures expiring on April 3 will inevitably be extended,"" Regional Affairs Minister Francesco Boccia told Italy's Sky TG24 television.
""I think that, at the moment, talking about re-opening is inappropriate and irresponsible.
""We all want to go back to normal. But we will have to do it by turning on one switch at a time.""
Italy is effectively sacrificing almost all forms of business activity to fight the pandemic that first emerged in China last year.
Deputy Finance Minister Laura Castelli said that the government's initial 25 billion euro ($28 billion) rescue package for affected families and companies might have to be quadrupled in size.
""In my opinion, at least 100 billion (euros) will be needed,"" Castelli told the La Stampa daily.
- 'Even stricter' -
Italy's death toll now stands at 10,779 and the number of officially registered infections is just under 100,000.
But officials brushed aside various data suggesting that both rates were slowing and that Italy might have already lived through the worst.
""We are in the midst of a pandemic,"" Health Minster Roberto Speranza told reporters.
""It would be a mistake to let our guard down.""
Government medical adviser Luca Richeldi warned that data pointing to a slowdown ""are a reason for us to be even stricter.
""We are in a very long battle,"" said Richeldi. ""Through our behaviour, we save lives.""
Ministers are expected to decide on the length of an extension in the coming days.
Conte has the right to keep the lockdown -- in full or in part -- until the existing state of medical emergency expires on July 31.
But there is nothing preventing his government from declaring a new one should restrictions be needed into the second half of the year.
Conte has indicated that he would like to see most measures lifted by June.
- Discontent -
Yet the strains on Italian society imposed by measures that might have seemed unimaginable just weeks ago are gradually starting to show.
The starkest example came when armed police began guarding entrances to supermarkets in Sicily after reports of looting by people who could no longer afford food.
Newspaper stories about growing discontent in one of Italy's least-developed regions appeared to be at least partially behind Conte's decision to make another TV appeal to the nation on Saturday.
Conte used it to announce a food voucher programme that will cost the government another 400 million euros ($445 million).
""We know that many suffer but the state is there,"" Conte said.
But this is only a stop-gap measure designed to help families cover grocery costs of between 25 and 50 euros on a one-time basis.
Projections from several global banks and think-tanks in the past week point to Italy's economic output shrinking by seven percent this year.
Those numbers are based on the assumption that the lockdown will not be extend far beyond April.

Three other tigers and three lions developed a dry cough, but are expected to recover.

    
“Our cats were infected by a person caring for them who was asymptomatically infected with the virus or before that person developed symptoms,” the Wildlife Conservation Society, which manages the zoo, said in a statement.
We tested the cat out of an abundance of caution and will ensure any knowledge we gain about COVID-19 will contribute to the world’s continuing understanding of this novel coronavirus.

Nadia, her sister Azul, two Amur tigers, and three African lions had developed a “dry cough” and have experienced “some decrease in appetite,” but were otherwise “doing well” under constant veterinary care.
While Zoo officials expect the animals to fully recover, they admit that it is “not known how this disease will develop in big cats” since different species react differently to infections and the incident apparently marks the world’s first officially confirmed Covid-19 case for a tiger.

1479	Dominion Post	2431990	Sam Sherwood	Man found dead in Wellington lodge after suffering flu-like symptoms	"A man in his 40s has died at the Pickled Parrot, a Wellington Lodge in Newtown.

Police are investigating the death of a man who had flu-like symptoms at a Wellington lodge last night.

Police responded to the sudden death of a man in his 40s at a Newtown address about 8.35pm on Sunday.

The cause of death is unknown but it is not being treated as suspicious, and the death has been referred to the Coroner, police said.

It's understood emergency services took a great deal of care in dealing with the man, aged in his 40s, and wore full personal protective equipment given the man had a high fever with recent coughing and breathing problems.

Wellington Free Ambulance were called to the scene following a 111 phone call.

The patient was classified as status two, meaning there was a potential threat to life.  Paramedics were wearing personal protective equipment, a spokeswoman confirmed.

Matthew Wright, owner of the Pickled Parrot Lodge where the man died, said the man was about 160kg with pre-existing health conditions which had recently put him in hospital, before he discharged himself and died at the lodge.

He believed the death was most likely from a heart-attack and had not heard of any suggestion of it being coronavirus.

The Pickled Parrot was exclusively for long-term accommodation and Wright was not aware of any residents who had been overseas recently.

The man had been living at the lodge for four or five years, Wright said.

A neighbour said fire and ambulance crews were seen at the lodge about 10pm.

The Ministry of Health has been asked for comment, but said any updates would be covered at its 1pm briefing.

A Capital & Coast District Health Board spokesman said the matter had been referred to the coroner.

West Coast woman Anne Guenole, 74, died of the virus on Sunday morning – the first death in New Zealand.

Guenole had initially been diagnosed with influenza that was complicated by an underlying health condition, but a positive Covid-19 test came through last Saturday."
1479	Dominion Post	2431992	Andre Chumko	Coronavirus: Mountain-biker winched off Wellington hill amid lockdown	"A mountain-biker had to be winched off a Wellington peak after going for a ride amid level-four lockdown.

Police have given cyclists clear guidelines: ""You must only be within the local area near your home – this is to help keep pressure off our emergency services and hospitals at this time.

""This is a short-term sacrifice, but we all need to do our bit to save lives.""

Mountain Bike New Zealand said people should ""only ride close to home"". It advises people to use bike trails and bike paths near you and that are accessible on your bike.

In a Facebook post, the group advised people to ride within their ability and ride easier tracks. ""This is not a time for shredding trails or ending up in hospital.""

Bikers are advised to ride at least two metres away from others, to ride solo or with those you're in isolation with, and respect trail and park closures.

Christchurch Single Track club has also advised people to keep rides short. ""This is a lockdown designed to stop the spread, not a chance to build your fitness.""

Yet on Sunday the mountain bike tracks around the Brooklyn wind turbine were teeming with mountain-bikers.

A Life Flight Westpac rescue helicopter spokesman confirmed that at 1.20pm on Sunday an injured mountain-biker had to be winched out.

Life Flight crewman Mike Beausoleil said the rider was in thick native bush about 200 metres below the turbine with severe injuries.

A paramedic had to be winched down to treat the rider then prepare them to be lifted into helicopter.

He did not want to comment on whether the rider should have been out during lockdown.

One woman said there were mountain-bikers ""everywhere"" in the afternoon.

St John Ambulance advised police of a report that a mountain-biker had broken their leg on a track.

""We are urging people to please respect the Alert Level 4 restrictions,"" a police statement said."

1479	Dominion Post	2142560	Andre Chumko	Coronavirus: Rules for cyclists unclear as riders descend on public areas en masse	"As people settle into a new way of life in their Covid-19 bubble it's clear not everyone is following the rules.

Road tension is bubbling up between errant cyclists and the few Kiwis left driving and walking the streets.

It comes as confusion reigns over the definition of staying ""local"" for bikers, as the country nears its halfway point for the coronavirus lockdown. And as some cyclists enjoy unprecedented freedom on the streets.

Patrick Morgan, from the Cycling Action Network, said debate had already surfaced online about cyclists taking up the country's streets.

The network supported the Government's directives that people are allowed out of their homes for exercise in their local area.

 * Health Minister David Clark apologises for ride

 * Coronavirus: Auckland cyclists flout lockdown rules

 * Kiwis are still getting to grips with restrictions

However, he said the advice was ""far from clear"" on what local exactly meant. Nobody in the Government seemed to be able to say, ""so people are making up their own minds about things"".

Last week in Auckland, one cyclist was caught clocking up a 76-kilometre joyride around the city. And even Health Minister David Clark has found himself caught up in the confusion, after being admonished by his prime minister for driving two kilometres for a ride on a nearby mountain-biking trail.

Morgan said interpretation of the rules varied from person to person, and from location to location. ""Given the lack of clear guidelines from the Government, it's no surprise people have a range of opinions.""

That said, Morgan reckoned the ""vast majority"" of cyclists were abiding by the rules.

""We also note that cycling is often a lightning-rod issue. It's the focus of discussion. Last week it was surfers copping some of [the] comment, this week it seems to be [cyclists].""

A police spokesperson said officers were asking people to stay local, apply common sense and not do anything that could risk injury or require search and rescue services.

They took on that risk on Sunday, when a mountain-biker broke their leg near Wellington's Brooklyn wind turbine. The biker was winched out and taken to hospital for treatment. A local woman said there had been bikers ""everywhere"" in the afternoon.

""The message is simple - stay home and save lives,"" the spokesperson said.

""We are urging people to please respect the Alert Level 4 restrictions.""

Morgan said cycling was a massively popular activity, done by more than one million New Zealanders. Most people, he said, didn't have a problem with cyclists.

""There's a vocal minority who just want to have a go at someone ... Cycling represents a challenge to the dominance of business as usual, so it's no surprise that cycling is often the focus of online discussions. We call it 'bikelash'.""

Morgan said the lockdown was offering a glimpse at how New Zealand's streets could operate differently, ""free from the dominance of motor traffic"".

Traffic pollution and crash numbers had plummeted, he said.

The network was advocating for further speed limit cuts during the lockdown period, as he said some motorists were ""taking it as a licence to speed and hoon, and that's unacceptable ... We deserve more.""

The health ministry was unable to clarify rules around cyclists.

Rory Mead, a Whitby resident who was training for paracycling for this year's paralympics before it was postponed, has found new freedom amid the lockdown.

On Sunday, Mead, accompanied by his neighbour and training partner Des McGorry, went for a ride around State Highway 58 at the Pāuatahanui Inlet, near Porirua.

Mead broke his neck in a crash during a race in 2014 in the United States. He now rides in a handbike, normally going out four to five times a week.

Usually, SH58 is too busy to ride on. But the emptying of streets has brought a new opportunity to try it out.

""I pretty much ride most roads around here anyway, so with lockdown I'm trying to take advantage of some of the roads I've never ridden before. It's a really nice piece of road: fun, a little windy, scenic spot, and the surface is really good.""

1004	The Daily Express	1269194	Martyn Brown, Senior Political Correspondent	China lies have 'COST LIVES': Fury erupts at Beijing's coronavirus disinformation	"MPs slammed the Communist state for making “false comments” about the virus which has killed more than 65,000 people globally. The Commons Foreign Affairs Committee said that as the country where the outbreak originated, China should have played a central role in collecting data on its spread. Instead, the committee said that right from the outset Beijing had sought to ""obfuscate"" over what was really happening. It called on the UK Government, working with international allies, to actively ""confront and rebut"" disinformation coming from foreign powers. In its the report, the committee also named Iran and Russia as being responsible for disseminating false information about the Covid-19 virus and suggested other countries were also involved.

Its main criticism, however, was reserved for China. It highlighted the way Li Wenliang, the doctor in Wuhan who first raised the alarm about the new disease, was forced to confess to ""making false comments"" before his death from the virus in February.
""Such deliberate misleading of the WHO (World Health Organisation) and scientists in other countries obscured analysis in the critical early stages of the pandemic,"" the committee said.
""Disinformation about Covid-19 has already cost lives. It is essential that the Government issues clear and transparent messages at home to confront and rebut disinformation spread by foreign powers.
""It must also work closely with allies to present a united front where possible, and to help ensure that vital international research efforts are not compromised by propaganda and bad data.""
Committee chairman Tom Tugendhat said Beijing had initially ""allowed disinformation to spread as quickly as the virus"".
He added: ""Rather than helping other countries prepare a swift and strong response, it is increasingly apparent that they manipulated vital information about the virus in order to protect the regime's image.
""The Government needs to tackle these lies with a clear and quick response, working with our allies to show a united front in the face of false facts and deadly disinformation.""

The committee also criticised the lack of international co-ordination in the effort to combat the disease and stop its spread.
It called for the creation of a ""G20 for public health"" to enable co-operation between expert researchers around the world to flourish, even in the absence of united political leadership.
""It is clear that existing regional and multilateral organisations, including the WHO, are not achieving the international co-operation needed to fight a global pandemic,"" it said.
""Although the Government is focused rightly on resolving the current crisis, it would be a catastrophic error to de-prioritise learning lessons from this pandemic and implementing them before the next one.""
It comes after a leading think tank accused China of systematically spreading disinformation.
Matthew Henderson, head of the Henry Jackson Society's Asia programme, said: ""China has been managing the crisis with disinformation, and its behaviour must affect the way we deal with Beijing in the future."""

        Scotland's chief medical officer has resigned after making two visits to her second home during the coronavirus lockdown.
Dr Catherine Calderwood had apologised for her actions, and initially said she planned to continue in the role.
She was backed by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who said Dr Calderwood had made a mistake but should stay in her job.
But Dr Calderwood released a statement later on Sunday saying she had quit. 
She said she had done so after speaking again to the first minister, and had agreed that the ""justifiable focus"" on her actions risked distracting from the pandemic response.
Dr Calderwood had earlier been given a police warning for breaking the lockdown rules after the Scottish Sun published photographs taken on Saturday of her and her family visiting Earlsferry in Fife - more than an hour's drive from her main family home in Edinburgh.
The chief medical officer had fronted TV and radio adverts urging the public to stay at home to save lives and protect the NHS, and took part in daily televised media briefings alongside Ms Sturgeon.

                    First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Dr Catherine Calderwood have held regular briefings
                
            
            
        Dr Calderwood issued an apology on Sunday morning and said she did not want her ""mistake"" to distract from the guidance on social distancing.
She later admitted during a press briefing that she had also made another visit to the property in Fife last weekend with her husband, but insisted she would be remaining in her post.
Ms Sturgeon said repeatedly during the briefing that she wanted Dr Calderwood to remain in her role as her advice and expertise were ""invaluable"" during the coronavirus crisis.
However, the first minister announced later on Sunday that Dr Calderwood would not be be attending any more briefings ""for the foreseeable future"" - although she would continue to offer the Scottish government scientific and medical advice. 
'Further conversation'
Dr Calderwood then released another statement at about 22:00, in which she said she was ""deeply sorry for my actions and the mistakes I have made"" and confirmed she was standing down as the country's chief medical officer.
She added: ""The first minister and I have had a further conversation this evening and we have agreed that the justifiable focus on my behaviour risks becoming a distraction from the hugely important job that government and the medical profession has to do in getting the country through this coronavirus pandemic.
""Having worked so hard on the government's response, that is the last thing I want.""
She also said she would work to ensure a smooth transition to her successor.

        Ms Sturgeon said it was ""clear"" that Dr Calderwood's mistake ""risks distracting from and undermining confidence in the government's public health message at this crucial time.
""That is not a risk either of us is willing to take.""
The first minister added that the ""very serious mistake"" made by Dr Calderwood should not detract from her ""highly valuable contribution to the medical profession and to health in Scotland"".
Dr Calderwood was appointed as Scotland's chief medical officer in March 2015. 
A former national director for maternity and women's health at NHS England, she was a leading medical expert in the inquiry into maternity care at Morecambe Bay.
Her deputy is Dr Gregor Smith, a GP and former medical director for primary care in NHS Lanarkshire. 
Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw described Dr Calderwood's decision to stand down as ""embarrassing and inevitable"".
Scottish Labour's health spokeswoman Monica Lennon said Ms Sturgeon should have ""nipped this in the bud"" earlier."

7109	Google News Italia (Italian)	1933371	Kiran Stacey	Biden says Americans might have to vote by post in presidential election	"Most Americans might have to vote by post in November’s presidential elections,
according to Joe Biden, the likely challenger to US president Donald Trump, who
also floated the possibility of a virtual Democratic party conference because of
coronavirus.

“I think it’s time we start thinking about how we’re going to hold elections . .
. Is it going to mostly be by mail, which is not the preferred route for
everyone — how are we going to do that? How are we going to make it available to
everybody?” the former vice-president told ABC News on Sunday.

Just under a quarter of votes were by mail in 2016.

Mr Biden suggested that his party might have to cancel its convention this
summer in Milwaukee and hold a virtual one instead to formally nominate its
presidential candidate. 

Mr Biden has an almost insurmountable lead over his opponent Bernie Sanders, and
is widely expected to be confirmed as the Democratic candidate during the
convention, which has already been pushed back a month until August thanks to
the disease.

said on Sunday that party members might not be able to gather in person at all
thanks to the severity of the outbreak. “We’re going to have to do a convention,
may have to do a virtual convention. I think we should be thinking about that
right now.”

Mr Trump on Saturday warned Americansto prepare for the “toughest week yet” of
the coronavirus pandemic, with the military ready to deploy 1,000 medical
personnel to New York. But Mr Trump also suggested some churches might still be
able to hold Easter gatherings, albeit outdoors and with “great separation”.

Mr Trump insisted that his own party’s convention in Charlotte, North Carolina,
would go ahead as planned. “We’re having the convention at the end of August and
we think by the end of August we’ll be in good shape,” Mr Trump said on
Saturday, insisting the convention would be “great”.

Meanwhile, the number of cases in the US continues to rise. Over 33,000 people
were confirmed to have the disease on Saturday, according to Johns Hopkins
University, as the spread of the virus continued to accelerate. So far 8,407
people have died in the country.

There was better news from New York, however, which has been the hardest hit of
any US state. Andrew Cuomo, the New York governor, said on Sunday that the
number of new coronavirus deaths had decreased slightly and that it was possible
the state had reached a plateau. 

“We could either be very near the apex, or the apex could be a plateau and we
could be on that plateau right now,” Mr Cuomo said, while cautioning that health
experts needed more data before they could make a definitive judgment. 

 New York recorded 594 deaths over the past 24 hours, down from the 630
announced on Saturday. The state’s positive cases grew to 122,031, an addition
of 10,841."
1479	Dominion Post	2144563	Laura Wiltshire	Immunocompromised workers say they were told to take unpaid leave or come to work	"Two essential workers say their company is forcing them to come to work, or take unpaid leave, throughout the lockdown, despite being immunocompromised.

The workers, who Stuff has agreed not to name, work for Latitude Financial Services; one has a respiratory condition, the other is diabetic.

They said the company asked for medical certificates to prove they required either special leave, or be allowed to work from home for the next four weeks, but were told no when they provided the certificates.

Last Thursday, their building had a confirmed case of covid-19, which their company notified them of on Monday, the workers claimed.

 * Coronavirus could see 'massive job losses' in home health care as workers leave the sector

One worker said she felt the company was prioritising money over workers.

Since providing the medical certificate she had been diagnosed with the flu and, with no sick leave left, was now on unpaid leave, she said.

The second worker said she had provided a medical certificate proving she was a diabetic and therefore should not be at work, but had been told to work or take leave without pay.

""I am very disappointed in the company.""

However, when approach by Stuff their employer said that both workers were on paid leave, contradicting their claims.

A spokeswoman for Latitude said any employee with an underlying health risk was urged to stay at home.

A new special leave policy had been established for those unable to work from home, which allowed workers with a high-risk health condition an extra 10 days of leave.

She disagreed with the workers claims that there had been a confirmed covid-19 case in the building last Thursday, saying the case was confirmed on Sunday.

The office had been deep-cleaned after the confirmed case of covid-19, and those who had been in close contact with the worker were told to self-isolate.

The spokeswoman said employees were able to access the Government's covid-19 leave payment, which was designed for people who needed to self-isolate.

Retail and finance organiser at FIRST Union, Kate Davis, said the union wanted all businesses to do everything they can to look after their workers.

A worker for Swissport, which does ground work for Jetstar, Virgin Australia, and Fiji Airways, said staff had been forced to take unpaid leave, and some had felt pressured into resigning.

The worker said the company told them they were not eligible for a wage subsidy, and had not given advice about what financial assistance they would be eligible for. ""They've left us in the unknown.""

A spokesperson for Swissport NZ said Covid-19 had led to an unprecedented situation for the aviation sector.

""At this stage, we are working on a case-by-case basis to ask some of our local team members to take leave without pay.

""We have also organised a number of cross-industry opportunities with organisations supplying labour to Countdown and Foodstuff to help keep as many members of our team in paid work for as long as possible.""

President of the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions Richard Wagstaff said at an affiliate meeting on Tuesday, unions had raised issues of employers not taking care of their employees during this time.

Concerns included companies laying people off rather than accessing relief packages, companies ""self-labelling"" as essential and telling their workers they had to continue working, and workers being forced to take sick leave or annual leave while on lockdown.

But he was pleased the majority of companies were doing right by their workers.

By Wednesday morning, the Ministry of Social Development had received 189,880 applications for the COVID-19 wage subsidy, and 17,113 applications for the COVID-19 leave payment.

Business New Zealand CEO Kirk Hope said it was important employers received the right information in what was a fast-moving situation.

The Government's Covid-19 website was a good source of information, and Business NZ advice lines were also open.

Not every business was going to survive, but the four-week lockdown gave employers more certainty than they had a month ago, Hope said."

The man had been admitted to a private hospital on March 26. He was already suffering from diabetes and had a permanent pacemaker, according to the hospital.

1476	Straits Times	941192		Europe's slowing coronavirus deaths bolster leaders on lockdowns	"ROME (BLOOMBERG) - Europe's four worst-hit countries reported declines in the pace of coronavirus deaths, and an Italian health official said his country's outbreak may be cresting.

Latest data from Spain, Italy, France and the UK suggested the containment measures that have idled millions of workers are having an effect, prompting political leaders to extend or tighten them to further stem the pandemic.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was hospitalised as a precaution after failing to shake off the virus and its symptoms for 10 days.

With the number of confirmed infections worldwide approaching 1.3 million, Italy and Spain have the biggest death tolls. That means officials have to weigh any attempts to restart parts of the economy against the risk of reigniting the spread of the virus and worsening the human toll.

""It's the lockdown measures that are helping us,"" Silvio Brusaferro, head of Italy's public health institute, said in Rome on Sunday (April 5). They have led to a ""significant slowdown in the spread"" of the virus, he said.

Italy reported 525 new deaths on Sunday, the lowest daily number in 2 1/2 weeks, Spain's toll declined for a third straight day and the UK's was lower than the previous day's. France reported an additional 518 deaths, the fewest since last Tuesday.

Deaths linked to the coronavirus reached almost 16,000 in Italy, more than 12,000 in Spain, 8,000 in France and some 4,900 in the UK. Italy has counted 128,948 infections, slightly fewer than Spain.

While his office said Mr Johnson remains in charge of the government, the prime minister's hospitalisation is likely to raise renewed questions about the UK's crisis response.

The government will tighten a nationwide lockdown if needed to halt the spread of virus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Sunday, as officials face demands to say how they will eventually lift restrictions.

Italy is heading into its fifth week under lockdown and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday he can't say when it'll be lifted. Opposition leader Matteo Salvini called on the government to open churches for the Easter holiday.

Italy's measures have been extended through at least April 13 and Spain's are now running in force at least until April 25. Conte is expected to announce revised rules and timelines by the end of next week, Il Messaggero newspaper reported.

Amid a global competition for scarce medical supplies, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said Chancellor Angela Merkel's Cabinet will approve a plan on Monday for the mass production of face masks. The government ""will provide guarantees so manufacturers know that they will get their money,"" he said on ARD television.

Queen Elizabeth II sought to lift her country's spirits in a rare televised address, urging Britons to adopt the discipline and resolve that the UK showed during World War II.

""I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge,"" the 93-year-old monarch said on Sunday. ""And those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any.""

Scotland's chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, said she'll resign after flouting UK lockdown guidelines to make a trip away from Edinburgh to her second residence.

Some EU leaders are actively looking beyond lockdowns.

Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz plans to present a detailed roadmap on Monday for eventually lifting restrictions, which include school and store closings and mandatory face masks. His country's number of active coronavirus patients dropped for the first time over the weekend as recoveries outnumbered new positive tests on both days.

Conte renewed his call for joint euro-area debt issuance that's also backed by Spain.

""As the Italian government, I invite all its European partners to approve a European recovery and reinvestment plan,"" he said on NBC. ""It's an ambitious common plan to rebuild the European economy to be financed through European recovery bonds."""
1476	Straits Times	941192		In Europe, landlords in peril as retail chains refuse to pay rent	"LONDON (BLOOMBERG) - The coronavirus is turning Europe's retail apocalypse into a nightmare for landlords and lenders.

Government-imposed lockdowns have shut stores across the region, leading retailers such as H&M to stop paying the rent. The threat of a ripple effect across the continent's real estate and banking sectors is looming.

At stake is not only the future of property companies, many of which are owned by funds managing the pensions of millions of savers and pensioners. The risk that real estate could trigger a wider financial crisis is rising again. More than 1 trillion euros (S$1.55 trillion) of debt is secured against commercial real estate in Germany, France and the UK alone, according to Cass Business School.

In Britain, a nation of shopkeepers whose stores are almost all closed, interest on about £180 billion (S$317.7 billion) of commercial property debt is due over the next few weeks.

""Since the crisis affects us all, everyone must pull together,"" said H&M chief executive officer Helena Helmersson. Almost 4,000 of the company's 5,000 stores are closed.

For troubled retailers, the coronavirus could be a tipping point, adding to landlords' woes. British department-store operator Debenhams may move to appoint administrators as early as next week to shield itself from creditors, according to media reports. Debenhams is making contingency plans ""with a view to protecting the business"", the company said in a statement.

Two of Britain's biggest mall landlords say they collected less than 40 per cent of the rent due this quarter. The British Property Federation estimates that the total March quarterly rent bill for UK retailers and leisure operators is about £2.5 billion. Revo, a UK retail lobby group, said it is even higher at £4.5 billion.

Landlords will face steep shortfalls in income if most retailers withhold rent on stores they cannot operate. That would make it harder for property companies to pay interest and avoid covenant breaches on loans. In the worst-case scenario, if there is no forbearance from lenders, banks could call in loans and repossess assets.

Melanie Leech, CEO of the BPF, said property companies need to be flexible on rent and support a distressed retail industry that employs millions of people across Europe. However, she said property companies also have ""duties and obligations to their lenders and investors, who represent the savings and pensions of 45 million people around the country"".

Several European countries are legislating to temporarily halt interest payments. In the UK, government support has mainly focused on tenants with relief on property taxes and help with wages.

""Lenders are flat-out dealing with calls from existing borrowers asking for waivers,"" said David Barry, a senior director in debt advisory at broker Jones Lang La Salle.

An analysis of the UK's top malls by Cass Business School senior research fellow Nicole Lux found that a 10 per cent drop in rents could lead to a funding shortfall of about £6 billion.

Intu Properties, Britain's largest shopping-centre owner, was already struggling to raise capital and slash debt before the virus outbreak.

The company said it has received just 29 per cent of the rents owed for the past quarter and warned it will take a tough line against any chains that unilaterally withhold payments. ""We have neither the desire nor the financial capacity to bankroll global, well-capitalised brands who have just decided they don't want to pay their rent,"" Intu said.

Several high-profile retailers across Europe have angered landlords and politicians by withholding payments despite taking advantage of government emergency support. H&M and Adidas sparked criticism in Germany by seeking concessions on their rents while planning to access emergency measures many in the country believe should be used to support smaller companies less able to withstand the crisis.

German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz called the sports giant's behaviour ""irritating"". Adidas has since backed down, paid its rent and apologised.

""We made a mistake and lost a lot of trust,"" the company said, adding that business is not operating normally anywhere in the world. ""Even a healthy company like Adidas can't stand that for long.""

Across Europe, the continent's biggest publicly traded retail landlords should have collected about 1.4 billion euros of rent last quarter.

In Britain, H&M angered property owners by asking for a rent holiday and threatening to exit leases early if the situation does not improve by June 23.

""This is an extreme situation,"" an H&M spokeswoman said in a statement. ""All activities in the company are now being carefully evaluated, including costs and risk perspective.""

Associated British Foods, the owner of discount-fashion chain Primark, held back £33 million of rent on its British stores. After it closed all its shops across Europe and the US, Primark is missing out on £650 million of revenue a month.

""These are extraordinary times and it is not as if this situation is pain-free for us,"" said John Bason, ABF's finance director. He and other company directors have taken a 50 per cent pay cut ""at a time when many Primark employees will see their livelihoods affected by Covid-19"".

Retailers are trying to mitigate the impact of the shutdown by cutting costs. UK store sales plummeted by a record 34 per cent in March, according to consultancy group BDO. Total sales, including online, fell 18 per cent.

Property owners face their own challenges. Chris Grigg, the CEO of British Land, said he has never experienced a crisis like this. The UK's fourth-largest listed property company waived quarterly rent for smaller retail tenants.

Vivienne King, CEO of retail lobby group Revo, stressed the need for cross-industry solutions and consensual negotiations.

""When the virus has passed, we will be looking at a very different world,"" she said."

On other darknet platforms, listings are rife with coronavirus keywords — with vendors selling everything from narcotic cocktails marketed as ‘coronavirus vaccines,’ to coronavirus-infected blood and saliva.
Monopoly Market to ban vendors using coronavirus as ‘marketing tool’
On April 2, dark web journalist, Eileen Ormsby, tweeted a screenshot posted by Monopoly Market’s operator that threatened permanent bans against vendors “caught flogging goods as a ‘cure’ to Coronavirus.”
“We have class here,” the post states.“You do not, under any circumstances use COVID-19 as a marketing tool. No Magical Cures, no silly fucking mask selling, toilet paper selling. None of that bullshit.” Monopoly Market also warns buyers:
“You are about to ingest drugs from a stranger on the internet — under no circumstances should you trust any vendor that is using COVID-10 as a marketing tool to peddle tangle/already questionable goods.”
Darknet markets rife with coronavirus listings
While Monopoly seeks to stamp out listings targeting coronavirus, vendors on other platforms are competing to capitalize on the public’s fears.
In addition to fake coronavirus antidotes and vaccines priced for hundreds of dollars, packs of surgical and N95 masks are being sold worldwide for an exorbitant premium. 
President Donald Trump’s recent statements concerning the potential for the drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have resulted in a similar emergence of listings for the anti-malarial drugs — despite experts warning that there is an absence of peer-reviewed evidence demonstrating their effectiveness in treating or preventing COVID-19.
A report published by The Independent shows listings for boxes of chloroquine priced at $200 each.
Some dark web entities push back against exploiting COVID-19
On March 19, cyber threat research company Digital Shadows published a report examining the reactions from the dark web community to the coronavirus pandemic.
The report concluded that while many cybercriminals have sought to “capitalize on fear and uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic,” the firm also “observed some atypical discussions from users,” — including “discouraging other users from profiting off the pandemic,” “expressing solidarity with countries affected,” and “providing health and safety information.”
On March 18, cybersecurity publication, BleepingComputer, reported that only two of seven ransomware operators contacted by the outlet had stated that they would not target hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic. 
This past week, Cointelegraph reported that IT professionals from 65 countries had banded together to fight ransomware targeting hospitals."

One of the most remarkable people we met working on this story was Holocaust survivor Max Eisen. He lives in Toronto but had traveled to Los Angeles for five long days of intensive interviews with the USC Shoah Foundation team, who asked him about his childhood in the former Czechoslovakia, his deportation to the Auschwitz concentration camp with his entire family when he was a teenager, and the horrors he experienced as a slave laborer in the camp.

Eisen's hours and hours of interview footage will be put into a database and processed so that people long into the future will be able to ask him their own questions, and artificial intelligence algorithms will retrieve the appropriate answer from the database, enabling real-time conversations with him to continue -- forever.

Amidst the tragic loss, cruelty, and horror Eisen experienced during the war, there were also acts of kindness, one of which saved his life. In the clip above, we watched as Eisen spoke about the Polish surgeon who he credits with his survival, and he told us about the last words his father told him as they were separated for the last time, which helped push him to take part in the project.

""And so my father gave me a blessing, which is a custom in a Jewish family, Friday night when we come home from synagogue. And he told me if I managed to survive, I must tell the world what happened here,"" Eisen said. ""This was the last thing that my father told me.""

Eisen turned 91 in March. Until a few weeks ago, when the coronavirus stopped all gatherings, he maintained a remarkable travel and speaking schedule, sharing his story widely. He's also written a memoir, called ""By Chance Alone."""

1260	The Mirror	1045516	Rachel Endley	MPs warn that disinformation about coronavirus pandemic spread is costing lives	"Disinformation about the pandemic spread is costing lives and hampering the fight against the disease, MPs warned today.

The Commons Foreign Affairs Committee said that as the country where the outbreak started, China should have played a central role in collecting data on its spread.

MPs also accused Iran and Russia of spreading fake news about Covid-19.

Their main criticism, however, was reserved for China, highlighting the way Li Wenliang – the doctor in Wuhan who first raised the alarm about the new disease – was forced to confess to “making false comments” before his death from the virus in February.

“Such deliberate misleading of the WHO and scientists in other countries obscured analysis in the critical early stages of the pandemic,” the committee says.

“Disinformation about Covid-19 has already cost lives.

“It is essential that the Government issues clear and transparent messages at home to confront and rebut disinformation spread by foreign powers.”

Instead, Beijing sought to “obfuscate” over what was really happening, the committee added.

Chairman Tom Tugendhat said: “Rather than helping countries prepare a swift response, they manipulated vital information about the virus in order to protect the regime’s image.

“The Government needs to tackle these lies with a clear response, working with allies to show a united front in the face of false facts.”"
142	Vanguard	1304590	David O Royal	How Nigerian Banks have fared in serving customers in COVID-19 era	"When President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday, March 30 2020, in his much-anticipated nationwide broadcast declared total lockdown in Lagos, Ogun and Abuja as a measure to contain the fast-spreading coronavirus disease [COVID-19] in the country, most Nigerians (particularly those in the affected states) panicked not knowing what lies ahead of them in the coming days as regards their banking needs.

However, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) through the Ministry of Finance quickly got the President to waive banking among other essential financial services from the lockdown, though still on a skeletal-mode.

As the reality of the COVID-19 pandemic fully unfolds, businesses, particularly the banking sector, have perfectly adjusted to ensure continued quality service delivery to their customers nationwide.

As the Banks face the litmus test of technology banking, some banks seem to be standing out of the crowd. At this point, Polaris Bank, Zenith, FCMB, Access Bank, GTBank, Ecobank and UBA are some of the banks helping customers weather the harsh realities of COVID-19.

Checks by our correspondents in some states not affected by the presidential lockdown orders like Ibrahim Taiwo Kano, Murtala Muhammed Way, Jos, Orereowu, Ado Ekiti and Afikpo Road, Abakaliki could not but laud the professionalism and attention to details of Polaris Bank staffers.

One of the Polaris Bank’s staff who spoke on condition of anonymity explained that they were under strict instructions from the Bank’s management to follow all social distancing rule and impress it on customers to follow all guidelines of checking their temperature and ensure they use sanitizers provided before the gain entry into the ATM gallery or banking hall.

While maintaining the existing social distancing rule, customers are properly screened and asked to wash their hands or use sanitizers before gaining entrance into the banking halls visited. The banking halls are also properly spaced to avoid unnecessary body contacts. The ATM galleries are also well-spaced and customers are mandated to sanitize their hands before and after using the machines.

However, there were few exceptions of rowdy sessions seen at branches visited by our Correspondents in Sapon, Abeokuta, Fagbewesa, Osogbo, Oyemekun Road, Ondo, Tunga Junction, Minna Niger State where customers seem unruly in trying to access the ATMs as some of them obviously were in panic mode to make cash withdrawals not wanting to take chances on availability of cash or not, despite assurances being dished out by staffers of the banks seen at those branches urging calm.

A customer who identifies himself simply as Kabiru at Sapon branch of Polaris Bank said he was not sure if he would get cash if it was his turn from the ATM or not as he did not believe which explains his apprehension and wanting to jump the queue.

Our checks reveal that despite having over 62 of its selected branches open for in-house businesses between 9am – 1pm daily, the Polaris Bank and Access Bank are regularly dishing out communication to advise customers (particularly those in the lockdown states) to take advantage of their alternative channels that will remain open and effective 24/7 to manage transactions and ensure that the lock-down does not result in a breakdown.

Riding above COVID-12 to deliver service seems to be the new Mantra in Polaris. Thumbs up to the new way of business."
55	Daily Mail UK	942731	Australian Associated	Casuals need year-long link for JobKeeper	"Casual workers will need to have at least a 12-month link with one employer to be eligible for the government's coronavirus wage subsidy program.

Industrial Relations Minister Christian Porter has ruled out broadening the scope of the $130 billion scheme, which will see eligible workers receive $1500 each fortnight.

""The fundamental principle is that you get it if you're a casual, if you've had a connection with your employer for that period of time,"" he told ABC radio on Monday.

The underpinning legislation will be debated in parliament on Wednesday as bureaucrats scramble to draft the laws.

The Morrison government wants to change the Fair Work Act to enable the temporary measures, but Labor and the unions fear unscrupulous companies could abuse the amendments.

Under the scheme, workers get a fortnightly pay of $1500 per person through their employers.

To be eligible, a for-profit company's turnover must have fallen by at least 30 per cent because of the pandemic.

Businesses with annual turnovers of more than $1 billion must have suffered a 50 per cent fall, while charities will only need to have suffered a 15 per cent hit.

The ACTU has suggested casuals should get the payments if they had a reasonable expectation of ongoing work, were it not for the virus.

""I just don't see that as a workable definition,"" Mr Porter said."

"April 5 (Reuters) - British aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce will abandon its targets on profits, cash and deliveries, and suspend its dividend, as airlines around the world ground planes due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Financial Times reported late on Sunday.

Rolls-Royce is also aiming to announce new credit facilities in excess of 1 billion pounds ($1.22 billion) to bolster liquidity, the newspaper said https://on.ft.com/2ULsL7q.

Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for large civil and military planes, has been hit hard by the pandemic as its airline customers park hundreds of planes.

In March, engine flying hours were down by about 40%, the newspaper said, citing a source. The company is paid by airlines based on how many hours its engines fly.

At the end of February, Rolls Royce had forecast 2020 free cash flow of 1 billion pounds, excluding any material impact from COVID-19. The group will ditch that pledge, the FT said.

The dividend payment of 11.7 pence per share, which has been frozen since 2016, will also be suspended, the newspaper added.

In addition, the FT said the company on Monday will reopen its civil aerospace facilities in the UK with a fraction of the normal workforce, after suspending operations in March.

The company could also eventually furlough some 50% of its 7,500 UK shop-floor workers, with wages supported by government subsidy, two sources told the newspaper."
16433	The Hans - India	681684	The Hans India	Coronavirus: Positive cases rise to 252 in AP	Amaravati: The growing number of corona positive cases in Andhra Pradesh is causing concern to the Government and Health authorities. The tally has reached 252 on Sunday with Guntur district alone reporting 30 positive cases forcing the authorities to impose complete lockdown in Guntur. According to Collector Samuel Ananda Kumar, from Monday no one will be allowed to enter Guntur or go out of the town. All red zone areas have been sealed and violators will face stern punishment. He called upon the retired staff of various departments like Health to extend their services in tackling the situation. State nodal officer Dr Srikanth Arja said that the maximum number of positive cases was 23 from Kurnool, followed by Chittoor with 17 positive cases. Two results each from Ongole and Nellore also came positive during the night. Currently, the maximum number of positive cases in Andhra Pradesh are from Nellore district where 34 samples have tested COVID-19 positive. Krishna district has 28 cases, followed by Kadapa and Prakasam districts with 23 cases each. Chittoor has 17 cases while Visakhapatnam and West Godavari have reported 15 cases each so far. East Godavari has 11 cases and Anantapur district has three positive cases. Vizianagaram and Srikakulam are the only districts to not have any reported COVID-19 cases. The state saw a spurt in COVID-19 cases after March 20, when a large number of people who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Delhi, between March 15-17, began returning to their homes. A number of foreign delegates at the congregation had transmitted coronavirus to the participants, resulting in the spike in cases in Andhra Pradesh. In view of this, Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy held a high-level review meeting on Sunday and directed the Health authorities to set up isolation wards at every hospital in the State and testing labs in every district. Jagan asked the officials to identify all those who had attended the Jamaat and their relatives and conduct tests for symptoms of COVID-19. He called upon the doctors and Health workers to take preventive measures while treating COVID-19 patients.
140	Zero Hedge	941845	Tyler Durden	Surgeon General: Next Week Will Be Our 'Pearl Harbor And 9/11 Moments'	"Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that next week's national coronavirus situation would be ""our Pearl Harbor moment,"" adding ""It's going to be our 9/11 moment.""

Responding to a question on state-specific stay-at-home orders, Adams said ""I talked to many of these governors, and here’s what I say to them. Here’s what I would say to them right now. The next week is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment. It’s going to be our 9/11 moment. It’s going to be the hardest moment for many Americans in their entire lives, and we really need to understand that if we want to flatten that curve and get through to the other side, everyone needs to do their part.""

Adams says that ""Ninety percent of Americans are doing their part - even on those states where they haven't had a shelter-in-place."" He then asked governors to give the Trump administration at least a week - if they can't give them 30-days, ""so we don't overwhelm our health care systems over this next week,"" adding that they would reassess at that point.

""We want everyone to understand; you have to be Rosie the Riveter. You have to do your part.""

Adams has also been backpedaling bigly on his February 29th recommendation to ""STOP BUYING MASKS"" - as he claimed they ""are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus.""

To cover his tracks, Adams told MSNBC ""Here's what's changed. We now know that, uh, about 25% and some studies even more, of COVID-19 is transmitted when you are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic.""

Except we've known about asymptomatic transmission since at least January; as we wrote on January 27th: ""Incubation is asymptomatic, contagious, and can be as long as 14 days.""

Meanwhile, several counties around the country are now mandating face coverings in public - and the CDC has considered recommending that people wear face masks all the time.

202	The New York Times	2431977	Jennifer Senior	Opinion | This Is What Happens When a Narcissist Runs a Crisis	"Since the early days of the Trump administration, an impassioned group of mental health professionals have warned the public about the president’s cramped and disordered mind, a darkened attic of fluttering bats. Their assessments have been controversial. The American Psychiatric Association’s code of ethics expressly forbids its members from diagnosing a public figure from afar.
Enough is enough. As I’ve argued before, an in-person analysis of Donald J. Trump would not reveal any hidden depths — his internal sonar could barely fathom the bottom of a sink — and these are exceptional, urgent times. Back in October, George T. Conway III, the conservative lawyer and wife of Kellyanne, wrote a long, devastating essay for The Atlantic, noting that Trump has all the hallmarks of narcissistic personality disorder. That disorder was dangerous enough during times of prosperity, jeopardizing the moral and institutional foundations of our country.
But now we’re in the midst of a global pandemic. The president’s pathology is endangering not just institutions, but lives.
Let’s start with the basics. First: Narcissistic personalities like Trump harbor skyscraping delusions about their own capabilities. They exaggerate their accomplishments, focus obsessively on projecting power, and wish desperately to win.


What that means, during this pandemic: Trump says we’ve got plenty of tests available, when we don’t. He declares that Google is building a comprehensive drive-thru testing website, when it isn’t. He sends a Navy hospital ship to New York and it proves little more than an excuse for a campaign commercial, arriving and sitting almost empty in the Hudson. A New York hospital executive calls it a joke.
Second: The grandiosity of narcissist personalities belies an extreme fragility, their egos as delicate as foam. They live in terror of being upstaged. They’re too thin skinned to be told they’re wrong.
What that means, during this pandemic: Narcissistic leaders never have, as Trump likes to say, the best people. They have galleries of sycophants. With the exceptions of Drs. Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, Trump has surrounded himself with a Z-team of dangerously inexperienced toadies and flunkies — the bargain-bin rejects from Filene’s Basement — at a time when we require the brightest and most imaginative minds in the country.
Faced with a historic public health crisis, Trump could have assembled a first-rate company of disaster preparedness experts. Instead he gave the job to his son-in-law, a man-child of breathtaking vapidity. Faced with a historic economic crisis, Trump could have assembled a team of Nobel-prize winning economists or previous treasury secretaries. Instead he talks to Larry Kudlow, a former CNBC host.
Meanwhile, Fauci and Birx measure every word they say like old-time apothecaries, hoping not to humiliate the narcissist — never humiliate a narcissist — while discreetly correcting his false hopes and falsehoods. They are desperately attempting to create a safe space for our president, when the president should be creating a safer nation for all of us.


Third: Narcissistic personalities love nothing more than engineering conflict and sowing division. It destabilizes everyone, keeps them in control.
What that means, during this pandemic: Trump is pitting state against state for precious resources, rather than coordinating a national response. (“It’s like being on eBay,” complained Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York last week.) His White House is a petty palace of competing power centers. He picks fights with Democratic officials and members of the press, when all the public craves is comfort.
Narcissistic personalities don’t do comfort. They cannot fathom the needs of other hearts.
Fourth: Narcissistic personalities are vindictive. On a clear day, you can see their grudges forever.
What that means, during this pandemic: Trump is playing favorites with governors who praise him and punishing those who fail to give him the respect he believes he deserves. “If they don’t treat you right, don’t call,” he told Vice President Mike Pence.
His grudge match with New York is now especially lethal. When asked on Friday whether New York will have enough ventilators, Trump bluntly answered “No,” and then blamed the state.
And most relevant, as far as history is concerned: Narcissistic personalities are weak.
What that means, during this pandemic: Trump is genuinely afraid to lead. He can’t bring himself to make robust use of the Defense Production Act, because the buck would stop with him. (To this day, he insists states should be acquiring their own ventilators.) When asked about delays in testing, he said, “I don’t take responsibility at all.” During Friday’s news conference, he added the tests “we inherited were “broken, were obsolete,” when this form of coronavirus didn’t even exist under his predecessor.
This sounds an awful lot like one of the three sentences that Homer Simpson swears will get you through life: “It was like that when I got here.”


Most people, even the most hotheaded and difficult ones, have enough space in their souls to set aside their anger in times of crisis. Think of Rudolph Giuliani during Sept. 11. Think of Andrew Cuomo now.
But every aspect of Trump’s crisis management has been annexed by his psychopathology. As Americans die, he boasts about his television ratings. As Americans die, he crows that he’s No. 1 on Facebook, which isn’t close to true.
But it is true that all eyes are on him. He’s got a captive audience, an attention-addict’s dream come to life. It’s just that he, like all narcissistic personalities, has no clue how disgracefully — how shamefully, how deplorably — he’ll be enshrined in memory."
1551	The Sun - UK	952843	Fiona Nimoni	Mark Wright on why he loves being in 24/7 lockdown with Michelle Keegan	"THEY have spent a large part of their five-year marriage living in different continents, but Mark Wright is now the envy of most men — he’s in lockdown with Michelle Keegan.

Having endured years of separation while Mark, 33, worked as a presenter in the US and Michelle, 32, filmed ITV drama Our Girl in South Africa, they are now isolating together in their Essex home.

Speaking to The Sun on video chat, former Towie favourite Mark, says: “After years of having a long-distance relationship, I’m now locked up with the girl of my dreams.

“We used to spend all our time on FaceTime calls and talking for hours on the phone in different time zones, but now we are together every minute of the day.

“It’s nice to just sit together in the evening in front of the TV without having to worry about rushing off.

“That time is important as a couple — just being together.

“We’ve been cooking together a lot and Michelle is a cracking chef.

“She has made a lot of delicious banana bread and lets me be her sous chef, so I help out.

“I really think this period is going to make everyone more grateful for the amazing friends and family they have.”

Mark has been connecting with friends on Instagram Live and shared a little too much during a recent chat with pop star Olly Murs.

Turning the camera on Michelle, who was sitting on the bed in a dressing gown, the former Corrie actress quickly shouts, “Er, hello, legs open!” and races to cover herself.

Both Mark and Olly are heard in hysterics, with Mark saying: “Giving Mursy a morning surprise.”

Mark has been thinking about family during lockdown, but will it mean having his own kids?

Mark says: “I would love to be a dad one day.

“I am a family man for sure — they are the centre of my world.”

And Mark, who was runner-up on ITV’s I’m A Celeb in 2011, has found staying in touch with friends and family online has been good for his mental health.

He says: “When I was in I’m A Celeb, I really struggled without them.

“I remember thinking, ‘If this doesn’t do anything for my career, or I get voted out early, I will be leaving the show to go to my family and friends, who I know will be there for me no matter what’.

“I know that is what has kept me so grounded in life.

“My friends would never let me get too big-headed, and that’s so important when you are in showbiz.

“I’m lucky I don’t suffer with many problems with my mental health, but the only time I do is when I am away from friends and family and Michelle.

“In LA, without my mates around me to bring back that normality, or my mum popping in, or Michelle to cuddle up with on the sofa at night, my anxiety builds up.

“I really am not myself.

“My friends say I ‘get in pickles’, because I can’t make decisions.”

Mark recently spoke openly on his Heart FM radio show about his anger at trolls following the death of his friend Caroline Flack in February.

He says: “I love social media in the most part but I have a real problem with trolling.

“I don’t get much negativity, but when I do it hurts me and it’s not nice.

“I just don’t see the point in going on social media to leave negative comments.

“Why do people need to do that?

“Why do people log on to leave negativity everywhere without thinking about the effect it might have on someone? It’s not kind.

“Luckily I can brush it off quite easily, but that’s not the case with everyone, especially when it’s extreme.

“I can see how it affects people and I just ask people to ask themselves why they are doing it. And to think twice.”

As well as giving the public an insight into his home life, Mark is also using social media to spread a positive message with exercise.

Often posting topless images of his gym-honed body, Mark has become a fitness inspiration for many of his 1.6million Instagram followers.

He says: “It’s nice, but I never set out to be a body role model.

“I love it when people ask for tips and come to me for fitness motivation because I’m very passionate about it.

“I love telling people how I train and what I eat and how they can feel good too. It’s a positive thing.

“If I wasn’t doing what I do I would be a personal trainer full-time.

“People say, ‘Oh it’s all genetics’ but that’s not the case.

“My friends call me a chubby boy waiting to come out, because if I don’t train and eat well I put on weight really quickly.”

Mark started a promising football career at a young age, getting signed to Tottenham Hotspur youth academy.

He says: “I was captain of the team at one point and I was the fittest I’ve ever been and all set to go far.

“That summer between seasons I thought, ‘I deserve a bit of rest’, and I went to Spain for a month to visit my cousin Elliot.

“I drank alcohol for the first time, ate what I wanted and didn’t train.

“I put on 22lb and it completely mucked up everything.

“My coach put me in the fat boys’ club on a strict diet and fitness plan, but I was behind the rest.

Making the most of his time in isolation, Mark — who came runner-up on Strictly Come Dancing in 2014 — has been sharing his #TrainWright home workouts to show others how to keep fit without a gym.

He says: “I want to show people that you really can get an amazing workout at home using your body weight, and it really doesn’t have to be longer than 30 minutes.”

Mark is also keeping busy with his Heart FM radio shows on Monday to Thursday evenings and Sunday morning, and he feels it is his responsibility to bring positivity to as many people as possible during the Covid-19 lockdown.

He says: “I wouldn’t say I find it easy to always be positive, it’s hard for everyone to be cheery all the time.

“But I am someone who likes to try to look at the best in life.

""I get to sit in a recording studio and tell people how I’m feeling, how I’m coping and I get all these amazing messages back from listeners.

“It’s a wonderful thing to have people try to lift others during this testing time.

“I know many people probably think I am incredibly lucky to be in lockdown with my beautiful wife — and I am.

“But we all have good things in our life, and I encourage everyone to look at what they have an enjoy it.

“Send that text to your friend, or call that family member, because staying in touch and letting those people know you are thinking of them, that matters now more than ever.”

The Pirates Of The Caribbean star posted a snap of Katy to his Instagram account last month, proudly writing: “My babies blooming.”



OLLY and his girlfriend, who began dating last summer and made it official in December, have occupied themselves in lockdown by pulling pranks on each other. For one, the singer put a handful of talcum powder in fitness-fanatic Amelia’s hair-dryer . . . much to her fury. He later wrote on his Instagram account: “Mission NOT impossible. #stilltogether #just.” The Essex native has also been dancing about in his underpants, singing at the top of his lungs.



THE Pussycat Doll has kept the flame with Thom burning brightly while posting dance and workout videos for her fans to move to. The couple have been dating since meeting on The X-Factor: Celebrity last year, when Nicole was a judge. They have not let the virus hit their enviable fitness levels. On one workout vid posted to Instagram, Nic told her 4.4milllion followers: “We’re back with a few easy at-home workouts in case you need a bit of motivation.”



DUA and her model fella know a bit of pampering is just the ticket in troubled times. The couple, who started dating last year, have been looking after their skin with fun face-masks to keep themselves entertained. The singer – who recently dropped her new album Future Nostalgia as a treat for fans during the pandemic – uploaded a sweet snap to her Instagram account of the pair sporting the muddy masks. It was captioned: “Self-care Sunday’s OK.”



GOLDENBALLS and his missus have posted various pics of family fun. The former England skipper also urged fans via Instagram to keep safe during the pandemic.

He wrote: “Staying at home for the ones we love. I’m staying at home for Victoria and our kids. Let’s stop the coronavirus spread together.”

644	Yahoo	948246		Coronavirus: India holds lights-off vigil as Modi calls for unity	"Indians have turned off their lights for a nationwide candle-lit vigil, heeding a call for unity as the country battles coronavirus.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked India's 1.3 billion citizens to observe nine minutes without electricity at 21:00 local time (16:30 GMT) on Sunday.
He urged them to ""challenge the darkness"" of Covid-19 by lighting candles and lamps.
Millions responded, lighting up the night sky in a show of unity.
""Salute to the light of the lamp which brings auspiciousness, health and prosperity, which destroys negative feelings,"" Mr Modi tweeted at the time of the vigil.
But critics have dismissed the event as a stunt, arguing it distracted from the health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Mr Modi imposed a nationwide lockdown on 25 March, announced with little warning, leaving millions stranded and without food.

There have been more than 3,500 confirmed infections and around 100 deaths from Covid-19 in India, the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University say.
The true figures, however, are thought to be far higher. India has one of the lowest testing rates in the world, although efforts are under way to ramp up capacity.

There are fears that a major outbreak in the country - one of the world's most densely populated - could result in a humanitarian catastrophe.
People are banned from leaving their homes under the lockdown measures. All non-essential businesses have been closed and almost all public gatherings are banned.
But the shutdown sparked an exodus from major cities such as Delhi, forcing thousands of migrant labourers to walk hundreds of kilometres to their native villages.
Last week, Mr Modi apologised for the impact of the strict stay-at-home measures, saying there was ""no other way"" to stop the spread of the virus.
The PM said the restrictions would remain in place for 21 days, but officials have warned that the lockdown could be extended in parts of the country."
644	Yahoo	2377141	By Aleem Maqbool - Bbc News, Washington	Coronavirus: Pastor who decried 'hysteria' dies after attending Mardi Gras	"Pastor Landon Spradlin wasn't worried about coronavirus when we went to New Orleans to preach during Mardi Gras. A month later he was dead.
""He loved to laugh. He loved to play guitar. He played guitar even when he wasn't supposed to,"" says Jesse Spradlin of her father, Landon.
""He was just the best man in the world.""
One day when this is all over, the wife and five children of Pastor Landon Spradlin hope to hold a large celebratory memorial for him.
For now they have had to make do with a funeral at which there were just two guests, including the blues guitarist who played at the graveside.
A little over a month ago, Pastor Spradlin, who was 66, drove with his wife Jean the 900 miles (1500 km) from their home in Virginia to Louisiana for Mardi Gras.
He viewed the festivities as an opportunity, through music, to save the souls of some of the hundreds of thousands of people that would attend.
He was joined by two of his daughters who came over from Texas.
""His mission was to go into pubs, clubs and bars, play the blues and connect with musicians and just tell them that Jesus loved them,"" says Jesse Spradlin, 28.
""Mardi Gras is like Times Square in New York during New Year's Eve. It's a sea of people just drinking and partying,"" she says. ""He was loud and laughing and in his element.""
Over recent years Pastor Spradlin had realised a dream of using the preaching he had honed in churches across three states and taking it to the streets through the medium he loved.
He had been playing instruments since the age of four and in 2016 was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame, but it was religion that he felt had saved him from alcoholism and drug addiction in his twenties.
Those dark years are why he now had a particular affinity for those who felt down and out, something he could relate to.
At Mardi Gras, the family band played in New Orleans' busy Jackson Square, unaware of the threat they faced.
""I don't even remember us talking about the virus,"" says Naomi Spradlin, 26. ""With what's happened we keep looking back, and we didn't talk about it once.""
They were not the only ones. Even though it had been more than a month since the first coronavirus case in the US, Mardi Gras went on as planned.
Officials in the city now blame government inaction for what appears to have been a large spike in cases that followed.
Pastor Spradlin was one of those who became ill, but tested negative for Covid-19. Even as he was sick, he posted on social media about ""hysteria"" surrounding the virus.
On the 13th of March Pastor Spradlin shared on Facebook a misleading post comparing swine flu and coronavirus deaths.
It suggested that Barack Obama and Donald Trump respectively had been treated very differently by the media and that it was a politically motivated ploy to harm President Trump.
Earlier the very same day, the president himself had insinuated something very similar at a news conference.
Pastor Spradlin's son, Landon Isaac, 32, told me that he and his father had talked and agreed about what they felt was an irrational frenzy and fear mongering about the virus, perhaps because it was an election year.
""I want to say outright though, dad didn't think it was a hoax, he knew it was a real virus,"" says Landon Isaac.
""But he did put up that post because he was frustrated that the media was propagating fear as the main mode of communication,"" he told me.
By mid-March though, Pastor Spradlin's health suddenly took a turn for the worse. He and his wife decided to make the long drive back from New Orleans to their home in Virginia.
""I spoke to him five minutes before he collapsed in North Carolina,"" says Landon Isaac.
""I could tell his breathing was getting bad. And I just said that you've got to get home. But he didn't make it.""
Pastor Spradlin was taken to hospital in North Carolina where they discovered he had developed pneumonia in both lungs and he now also tested positive for the coronavirus.
After eight days in intensive care, Pastor Spradlin died.
""It's a lot like Dad was our support column and somebody kicked out that support column. It feels like the roof is falling down on all of our heads right now,"" says Landon Isaac.
For days, he and his four siblings had to communicate with their mother through the glass door of her home. The funeral that has just taken place happened the day after Jean Spradlin's quarantine finally ended.
""We just never thought our father would pass away because of this. But he wasn't the type of person to just live in fear and let it rob him of the joy of the life that he had,"" says Jesse Spradlin.

She does think that mixed signals and, as she sees it, an inability to trust the media contributed to confusion about the virus.
""I was frustrated with the way that the media was very agenda driven - and it's on both sides. I feel like the coronavirus issue turned into something that was 'party against party' instead of one nation under God,"" she says.
Jesse said that the longstanding polarisation of the American media made it hard to know what to believe and what is political hype.
The TV coverage of the crisis and the president's handling of it is starkly different depending on the stance of the network.
And it is striking how Americans appear to view the pandemic differently depending on their politics; polls show Republicans are more inclined to think there has been an over-reaction to the coronavirus; Democrats, that it is not being taken seriously enough.
Jesse feels that the magnitude of the crisis, one that took the life of her father, means that needs to change.
""There's still so much on the news that is agenda driven, even though people are passing away,"" she says.
""This is affecting our country, and unless we start acting like one nation we are not truly going to find a solution. But for that to happen, a certain amount of humility is needed."""
644	Yahoo	2431976	By Joao Fellet - Bbc Brasil	Coronavirus 'could wipe out Brazil's indigenous people'	"Indigenous communities in the Amazon region and elsewhere in Brazil are in danger of being ""wiped out"" by the coronavirus, according to health experts.
Respiratory illnesses - such as those that develop from the influenza virus - are already the main cause of death for native communities.
By Sunday 5 April, Brazil had reported more than 11,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 486 deaths.
Infections were initially concentrated in the industrialized state of São Paulo. However, they have now spread across the country, including to indigenous territories in the Amazon basin that are the size of France and Spain combined.
The first case among indigenous peoples was recorded in Amazonas state.
Indigenous groups make up 0.5% of Brazil's population

""There is an incredible risk of the virus spreading across the native communities and wiping them out,"" says Dr Sofia Mendonça, a researcher at the Federal University of São Paulo (Unifesp).
Dr Mendonça is the co-ordinator of a university-led health project among indigenous peoples in the Xingu river basin in the Amazon rainforest.
She fears the coronavirus could have a similar impact to previous major outbreaks of highly contagious respiratory diseases such as measles.
In the 1960s, a measles outbreak among members of the Yanomami community living near the border with Venezuela killed 9% of those infected.
""Everyone gets sick, and you lose all the old people, their wisdom and social organization,"" Dr Mendonça says. ""It's chaos.""
In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, she adds, some communities are planning to split into smaller groups and seek refuge inside the forest. That is how they avoided extinction during past epidemics.
""They will gather materials needed for hunting and fishing and will set up camps, waiting there until the dust settles,"" she says.

Many communities lack the means to reduce the risk of contagion, such as washing hands with soap and water, or using hand sanitizer.
People also often live in close quarters with each other and share bowls and glasses, both of which help infectious diseases spread more quickly.
They are now being advised to stop sharing utensils and to use traditional seclusion practices - such as those applied to women after they give birth - to isolate people with the symptoms of Covid-19.
Indigenous communities also live in areas where there is limited access to healthcare, particularly intensive care beds.
Taking measures into their own hands
But as the virus spreads across Brazil, many are questioning whether the government will seek to protect indigenous groups, which make up 0.5% of the population.
President Jair Bolsonaro is seen by many indigenous leaders as an enemy of their cause. He has said Brazil's indigenous lands are too big and that their natural resources should be shared with the rest of the population.

While many governors and mayors have ordered restrictions to reduce infections, the president has compared the coronavirus to a ""a little flu"" and advocated reopening schools and shopping centres.
In the face of government inaction, several indigenous organisations have asked their communities to suspend trips to cities and prevent visitors from entering their territory.
""Whoever is a true friend understands our fragility. Let's keep the coronavirus away from the villages,"" said a banner posted on a road in Mato Grosso state by members of the Karajá indigenous people.
Even with such precautions, experts say it is likely Covid-19 will eventually reach some villages and that it will be necessary to isolate the sick before they infect people in contact with them.
Experts also warn about the grave threat the coronavirus poses to indigenous groups who already live in voluntary isolation.
According to the federal agency for indigenous affairs, Funai, there are 107 known indigenous groups in Brazil's Amazon that have no contact with the outside world.
However, illegal loggers, hunters and evangelical missionaries are operating in their territories. And indigenous organisations and NGOs say there has been a sharp increase in incursions in recent years.
Funai has also had its budget slashed by consecutive administrations, making it harder for the agency to protect remote communities.
There are now fears that the battle against the coronavirus will further reduce its resources to protect the forest and those living in it.
While most indigenous groups agree they should avoid visiting cities to reduce the risk of infection, many leaders say people could go hungry if they have no access to markets.
In São Gabriel da Cachoeira, an Amazonian municipality that borders Colombia and Venezuela, thousands of members of local groups travel on boats to the city each month to receive pensions and access government cash-transfer programmes.
The expansion of such programmes in recent decades means some communities have stopped hunting for and growing their own food, and now rely on them to survive.
Marivelton Baré, president of the Federation of Indigenous Organizations of Rio Negro (Foirn), says many local communities are ""in a panic"".
""We'll need to take the food to the villages so that they don't expose themselves during this critical moment,"" he says.
There are no ventilators in São Gabriel da Cachoeira's hospital, so a seriously ill patient would need to be sent to the capital of Amazonas, Manaus - a 1,000km-long (620-mile) boat journey away.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, a nurse working for the Special Secretariat for Indigenous Health (Sesai) says its staff have no testing kits to detect Covid-19, and that there are not enough protective masks and other equipment to deal with cases in indigenous villages.

Sesai itself told the BBC it had provided ""a series of technical documents, so that indigenous peoples, managers and employees could be guided to adopt measures to prevent coronavirus infection"".
The agency added that all its health teams had received training on how to treat patients.
But it did not comment on the fears of food shortages in villages.
Funai, the federal agency for indigenous affairs, did not say how it would tackle hunger and land invasions during the pandemic.
Mr Baré says the government has not offered any help and that people will start to ignore the advice to stay in their villages if their food stocks run out.
""If the choice is either being infected or going hungry, most will choose the first,"" he warns. ""Then the consequences will be dire."""
